I actually requested wuzado to get channel downloads on the first of the month just in case something were to happen

#general *should* have an archive from that time in case we can‚Äôt get discord to restore the channel, but wuzado ran into some issues when downloading so it wasn‚Äôt fully completed

[19-Jun-22 08:03 PM] Ethan#0420
i very clearly remember stating my doubts about not letting someone who is more well-established in the community make the server


[19-Jun-22 08:03 PM] summers#0577
i was defending her making the server, not her character


[19-Jun-22 08:03 PM] kibo#1629
which in hindsight I dont know why she even did that since even I dont think I deserved the unban

I hacked on the server when I first joined it since I figured it was gonna be run into the ground and ascendancy would be more sucessful :civ:

they are so easy u just mix berries, sugar, flour and lemon, throw it in a pan and then melt some butter, add flour and sugar and crumble it on top and bake


[19-Jun-22 08:31 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
use grams


[19-Jun-22 08:31 PM] Submadoge#0472
this ice cream chain shop i live next to makes apple pie concretes where they just take a slice of pie and stick it into vanilla ice cream and blend it

You don‚Äôt need to get the shape exactly right when ur rolling it out since you cut it into strips and it‚Äôs harder to accidentally ruin

[19-Jun-22 08:32 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
they are inaccurate if u use grams u don‚Äôt have to know how to measure you can‚Äôt mess it up


[19-Jun-22 08:32 PM] dragonam#8155

[19-Jun-22 08:32 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[19-Jun-22 08:32 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[19-Jun-22 08:33 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
with pie that‚Äôs ok because there‚Äôs not a lot of ingredients but with cakes, cookies you‚Äôll fuck it up


[19-Jun-22 08:33 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
very fitting


[19-Jun-22 08:33 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
with pie if u add more or less flour/sugar it‚Äôll just be more or less sweet/thick but still edible


[19-Jun-22 08:33 PM] OhBoy#1331

[19-Jun-22 10:01 PM] Ninobf#8750
that era of tg was famously known for nobody being weirdly sexual to others


[19-Jun-22 10:01 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
what was y'all's favourite reset?


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Submadoge#0472
1.16 obviously


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
i agree


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Ninobf#8750
1.15 or 1.16


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] workingonaname#2467
1.13


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
i wasnt very present but 1.16 was pretty cool


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Biotic#5170
1.15


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Submadoge#0472
you are in the minority


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Murdock#2037

[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Submadoge#0472
this is the same server


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Submadoge#0472
just


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] Submadoge#0472
a tad different


[19-Jun-22 10:02 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
so


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
if that's the case what's the worst era of tg


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] Submadoge#0472
1.17


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] Biotic#5170
1.17


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
besides 1.17


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
i mean


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] Ninobf#8750
tgn 1.14 or tgf


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] Ninobf#8750
and 1.17


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
because that's just inactive


[19-Jun-22 10:03 PM] Submadoge#0472
1.17


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] summers#0577
the only good part of 1.17 was the events TBH


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] WarheroesINC#5337
yeah


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] summers#0577
@Salt don't you agree :)


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] Submadoge#0472
yeah probably 1.18


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] Submadoge#0472
solely


[19-Jun-22 10:04 PM] Submadoge#0472

5space do you have a website or anything where you keep these monstrosities


[20-Jun-22 01:00 AM] 5space#8508
i put together an album of them last year


[20-Jun-22 01:01 AM] 5space#8508
my website is very awesome and cool https://5space.me

[20-Jun-22 01:01 AM] 5space#8508
True


[20-Jun-22 01:02 AM] kibo#1629
Girl who sits next to me in comp sci used to routinely send people iploggers to get info on them because she thought it was funny


[20-Jun-22 01:02 AM] kibo#1629
It was kind of funny but she was surprised it didn't work on me :p_:


[20-Jun-22 01:03 AM] 5space#8508
A wee bit of trolling


[20-Jun-22 01:03 AM] kibo#1629
Idk why she thought I would click on a  website that literally had iplogger in the name but whatever


[20-Jun-22 01:04 AM] kibo#1629
She also broke her hard drive irreparably the other week


[20-Jun-22 01:04 AM] kibo#1629
I took it off her to see if I could fix it but that shit wouldn't boot whatsoever


[20-Jun-22 01:05 AM] kibo#1629
It was kind of impressive


[20-Jun-22 01:05 AM] 5space#8508

It wasn't even a website that was supposed to be faking being something else it literally had iplogger in the domain name

I kind of regret taking comp sci


[20-Jun-22 01:09 AM] kibo#1629
Not because its difficult its just that the class is filled with redditors


[20-Jun-22 01:09 AM] tester1#2789
Aren‚Äôt u a Redditor too


[20-Jun-22 01:09 AM] kibo#1629
Not really


[20-Jun-22 01:10 AM] kibo#1629
I only use it when I have weird obscure tech problems


[20-Jun-22 01:10 AM] tester2#8183
I‚Äôd guess they mean the kind of redditor to use chonker or doggo unironically


[20-Jun-22 01:11 AM] kibo#1629

[20-Jun-22 01:28 AM] dti131#8960

[20-Jun-22 02:53 AM] haha yes#0921
true


[20-Jun-22 02:54 AM] haha yes#0921
its bringing piracy back at least


[20-Jun-22 02:54 AM] haha yes#0921
the worse paying for things gets, the bigger the piracy scene is


[20-Jun-22 02:54 AM] haha yes#0921
which means piracy gets more advanced and easier


[20-Jun-22 02:54 AM] haha yes#0921
there will always be a way


[20-Jun-22 02:55 AM] dti131#8960

Yeah here too


[20-Jun-22 09:56 AM] emu#8271
Also why india


[20-Jun-22 09:56 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
But in the states you never get a chance to even learn bc nobody has a stick car

[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Hapho#3077
you need to learn how to drive manual to get your license


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
One of my friends offered to teach me a while back but he drives a Camaro and it would be very expensive to blow out the clutch on that thing


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
Yeah in the states you don‚Äôt


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] emu#8271
Matic?


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Hapho#3077
95% of cars here are stick


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Cheese_Addict#3663

Baltic


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Hapho#3077
quite the opposite here, automatic cars are more expensive for their motors


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Joeffended#8749
wtf


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
In India there‚Äôs separate geared and non geared licenses but it‚Äôs best to get a geared license


[20-Jun-22 09:57 AM] Xenogenix#9300
Manual cars are best


[20-Jun-22 09:58 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
No I mean learning on that car would be a bad idea in case I break something so I‚Äôd rather not


[20-Jun-22 09:58 AM] emu#8271
Imagine using matic or manual


Motorbike best


[20-Jun-22 09:58 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
Automatic yeah

If whippper has a million fans, then I am one of them. If whippper has ten fans, then I am one of them. If whippper has only one fan, then that is me. If whippper has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world against whippper, then I am against the world.

Nothing happened on 6/19/2022. The admin bot was not backdoored, and the discord server was not wiped, with half of staff banned and millions of messages deleted. It was an entirely normal day in TGF history, with an entirely normal average playercount of 1.47, and an entirely normal number of backdoors of 0. There were not massive internal community unravelings, nor were there changes to the staff structure. Muzak was not instated as a discord mod and exgodstatus was not instated as an admin. Perhaps the only noteworthy thing about this day is that it was among the most normal, uninteresting days in TGN history.

         Because I was not a retired mod.

    Then they came for the tgn mods, and I did not speak out‚Äî
         Because I was not a tgn mod.

    Then they came for the fries, and I did not speak out‚Äî
         Because I was not promised fries.

i had a nightmare where tgf introduced a new rule called "Do not enter the steel tube unauthorized." with a 12 point penalty, and seemingly random people were getting pointed for it. but then, people realized that if they went into their bathroom there would be a- roughly 5 feet tall- metal tunnel coming from one of the walls, and somehow the mods knew when you entered it. magnar decided to stream entering the "steel tube" in vc to see what happened. when he entered the tube the bathroom disappeared behind him, leaving only an infinite tunnel in either direction. magnar started to walk in one of the directions, but suddenly salt stabbed him in the back, picked up his phone, and turned off the stream. anyone who was in the vc got pointed for "forbidden thoughts"

not that far on my front but some ppl def did


[20-Jun-22 06:05 PM] 5space#8508
What do you mean bro, what she did totally deserved getting doxxed and harassed for a year straight!!!!

i pr much never understood why she got so much hate


[20-Jun-22 06:06 PM] 5space#8508
People hated her character


[20-Jun-22 06:06 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
to be completely honest her community interactions were not very good but nothing that warranted the shit we gave her


[20-Jun-22 06:06 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
also 100% just general sexism mostly from awil at the time

She was more of a reddit and discord leader and should have allocated more mc control to the mod team

[20-Jun-22 06:06 PM] Cooopl#5402
I heard caro devoted much with the internals of the server so it didn‚Äôt look like she was doing much


[20-Jun-22 06:07 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
her mistake was not appointing muzak as tgntl

White a fanfiction of TecnaGamer
```
TecnaGamer was sitting in her room, playing on her laptop. She was in the middle of a huge project and she was determined to finish it. However, she was soon interrupted by a knock on her door.

"Who is it?" She called out.

"It's me, White." Came the reply.

TecnaGamer sighed. White was her best friend, but she was always interrupting her when she was trying to work.

"What do you want?" She asked, not bothering to hide the annoyance in her voice.

"I just wanted to talk to you." White said.

"Can't it wait? I'm kind of busy." TecnaGamer said.

"No, it can't." White said. "This is important."

TecnaGamer sighed again and saved her work. She got up and opened the door.

"What is it?" She asked.

"I need to talk to you about something." White said.

"What is it?" TecnaGamer asked, now feeling a little bit worried.

"It's just that, I don't know how to say this." White said.

"Just say it." TecnaGamer said.

"I think I'm in love with you." White said, finally getting the words out.

TecnaGamer was stunned. She had never thought of White in that way before.

"I'm sorry." White said, seeing the disbelief on TecnaGamer's face. "I know you don't feel the same way. I just had to tell you how I felt."

"No, it's okay." TecnaGamer said, finally finding her voice. "I'm just surprised, that's all. I had no idea you felt that way."

"So, you're not disgusted or anything?" White asked.

"No, of course not." TecnaGamer said. "I'm just surprised, like I said. I never thought of you in that way before."

"I know." White said. "I just had to tell you how I felt. I hope you're not too mad at me."

"I'm not mad at you." TecnaGamer said. "I'm just surprised. But it's a good surprise."

"Really?" White asked, hopeful.

"Yes, really." TecnaGamer said, smiling.

White smiled back and the two friends hugged each other. They both knew that things would never be the same between them, but they were okay with that.

Tecna Encounters A Vaporeon!
```
One day, Tecna was walking through a forest when she saw a Vaporeon! Vaporeon was a beautiful blue Pokemon with a long body and a big fin on its back. Tecna was amazed by its beauty and wanted to get a closer look. She slowly approached Vaporeon, but Vaporeon didn't seem to notice her. Tecna got closer and closer until she was right in front of Vaporeon. Vaporeon finally noticed Tecna and stared at her with its big blue eyes. Tecna felt a connection with Vaporeon and knew that they would be friends.

accurate


[20-Jun-22 07:59 PM] Hapho#3077
did you know that you sleep in 1h30m cycles

so if you want to wake up feeling fresh and well rested, you should set your alarm precisely at the end of the last cycle (life hack) 

for me it's actually 2 cycles in a package of 3 hours because my sleep cycles are weird so I plan my naps for 3,6 or 9 hours


[20-Jun-22 08:00 PM] Hapho#3077
no matter how much you sleep, if you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, during rem sleep, you will feel tired


[20-Jun-22 08:00 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
yeah ive heard about that!


[20-Jun-22 08:00 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
i always set my alarm exactly 8 hours after i go 2 bed


[20-Jun-22 08:00 PM] Hapho#3077
if I time my alarms right I actually don't mind getting up in the morning

it's actually a good piece of advice to know


[20-Jun-22 08:01 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
8 hours is uneven?


[20-Jun-22 08:01 PM] √üupp#2372
I know


[20-Jun-22 08:02 PM] Hapho#3077
no it probably takes you like 15 mins to fall asleep and not all sleep cycles are the same, some may be longer or shorter


[20-Jun-22 08:02 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
makes sense


[20-Jun-22 08:02 PM] Hapho#3077

jonathan was just an idiot in s4


[20-Jun-22 08:20 PM] Hapho#3077
ngl season 1 and 2 of stranger things feel WILDLY different from 3 and 4
especially if you rewatch it now

season 1 and 2 was more like true mystery but 3 and 4 is more developing on the characters who get themselves in absurd situations


[20-Jun-22 08:21 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
3 was very different and did nt feel like st


[20-Jun-22 08:21 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
4 has a similar vibe it probably just seems different because of the age differences in the kids


[20-Jun-22 08:21 PM] hairyasshole#9590
I like how steve got clocked once and he‚Äôs instantly the best

[20-Jun-22 08:21 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
i can‚Äôt wait for part 2


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] emerald#2123
his relationships with robin and dustin are great


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] Submadoge#0472
i cant even remember what is happening in stranger things anymore


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] Hapho#3077
my mans Jonathan got let down


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
season 4 has already been so good and hasn‚Äôt even had a true finale


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] Submadoge#0472
i have no memory of season 1


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] WinterStars#2131

[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
robin became annoying in s4 tho


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] Hapho#3077
rewatch it, its great


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] emerald#2123
also true


[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958

[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] Submadoge#0472

[20-Jun-22 08:22 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958

[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
she got too annoying last season she was cool and chill this season she was lowkey neurotic


[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] Hapho#3077
eleven is scared of Robin /j


[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
tho it‚Äôs controversial


[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
some people still love her


[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] emerald#2123
and will


[20-Jun-22 08:23 PM] Hapho#3077
I love the horror on millies face when she enters the rainbow room and tries to leave

[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] Hapho#3077
will is missing and he'd rather take pictures of nacny having sex


[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] magnar#3825
he looked like a fucking loser too


[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] hairyasshole#9590
he looked like a school shooter


[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
steve wasn‚Äôt even bad in s1 the only bad thing he did was tell jonathan his family was screwed up in the alley way


[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] Hapho#3077
fr


[20-Jun-22 08:25 PM] hairyasshole#9590
and he wrote the thing on the movie

that‚Äôs questionable


[20-Jun-22 08:26 PM] Hapho#3077
ngl season 3 and 4 felt too futuristic
season 1 and 2 especially accented the CRT's and satellite TV being a pain and other things


[20-Jun-22 08:26 PM] hairyasshole#9590
ohh


[20-Jun-22 08:26 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958

I mean idk if Thai police can like demand that information from servers based in other countries though


[21-Jun-22 01:40 AM] Submadoge#0472
ive been called submadoge like, 4 times ever


[21-Jun-22 01:40 AM] magnar#3825
they were like: "but she has mental ilness.."


[21-Jun-22 01:40 AM] not big guy alt#1594

[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] theradrad19#4849
suvmadoge


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] emu#8271
yea ikr that doesn't justify wanting to fuck kids


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
Like a user in Thailand would probably be using the servers located in Hong Kong


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] theradrad19#4849
submadoge


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
yeah and why is my name never shortened to __


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] Submadoge#0472
speaking of submadoge


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] Submadoge#0472

[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] emu#8271
ok


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] emu#8271
you are fear


[21-Jun-22 01:41 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
I‚Äôm still really sorry about uku because there was a past ban that should have been an indicator that I didn‚Äôt see, but if I had I likely would have probed further and found out about what was going on much sooner


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
That‚Äôs absolutely on me


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Submadoge#0472
it hurts to move my nose and my mouth tastes like stomach acid


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Submadoge#0472
what


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Submadoge#0472
why are you blaming yourself for uku


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Submadoge#0472
uku had loads of red flags but i always thought that they were reasonable


[21-Jun-22 01:42 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
Not for the situation but for not handling it way way way earlier


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] emu#8271
same, i  saw red flags in uku ever since i first met her


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] Submadoge#0472
same thing


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] 5space#8508
Every single person that participated in the phd server enabled this shit


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] ablazingeboy#7375
Yeah but part of our job as mods is to catch those red flags and intervene accordingly


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] 5space#8508
That is a fact


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
blazing can you replace the uku in spawn with hatsune miku


[21-Jun-22 01:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] Submadoge#0472

[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] Submadoge#0472

[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] Submadoge#0472
do my ticket


[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
spawn was originally going to be


[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
ninotown on top


[21-Jun-22 01:46 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
what the FUCK


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
mine was very appealing


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] theradrad19#4849
oen more spot


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] Hapho#3077
actually


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] theradrad19#4849
whats one more spot


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] Hapho#3077
the votes were better for others


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] theradrad19#4849
L


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and why was my votes bad?


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
probably those reasons


[21-Jun-22 04:27 AM] theradrad19#4849
and yet you ask for her help in events... curious...


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
which are pretty good reasons tbh


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
no i had to ask them to let me


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] theradrad19#4849
oh


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] Hapho#3077
to be fair you didn't get instantly declined or marked as ineligible


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
real


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] theradrad19#4849
WTF my assumption was WRONG


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
im assuming it was like a ton of yesses a few maybes and like 1-2 nos


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] theradrad19#4849
how many people applied


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and other people didnt have those nos


[21-Jun-22 04:28 AM] Hapho#3077
yeah about in the ballpark


[21-Jun-22 04:29 AM] Hapho#3077
there were a lot of maybes


[21-Jun-22 04:29 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[21-Jun-22 04:29 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[21-Jun-22 04:29 AM] theradrad19#4849

so im just adding everything and making it fucking poggers


[21-Jun-22 04:30 AM] Hapho#3077
we've got a storyline figured out and we think steel tube can be more of a mini-event with no relevance to the story


[21-Jun-22 04:31 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
awesome

[21-Jun-22 04:32 AM] Hapho#3077

Gop is just pushing to get a vote next year


[21-Jun-22 06:02 AM] Salat#5744
Its not official


[21-Jun-22 06:02 AM] emu#8271
is california self sufficient


[21-Jun-22 06:02 AM] Hapho#3077
we are investigating


[21-Jun-22 06:02 AM] Murdock#2037
the governing body saying they want to do it is a pretty official sounding statement


[21-Jun-22 06:03 AM] Salat#5744
They are still subject to the rule of the federal goverment


[21-Jun-22 06:05 AM] Murdock#2037
I dont think that the federal government would ever just let them do the vote


[21-Jun-22 06:05 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
you can't leave the union üíÄ


[21-Jun-22 06:05 AM] Murdock#2037
which means that if they ever had any intention of actually seceding, then it would have been planned to happen without the government's approval


[21-Jun-22 06:05 AM] Murdock#2037
they could very well just be doing this for smoke and mirrors


[21-Jun-22 06:06 AM] Salat#5744
Which would recquire military action


[21-Jun-22 06:06 AM] Murdock#2037
yes


[21-Jun-22 06:06 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
supreme court precedent says they can't secede


[21-Jun-22 06:06 AM] Murdock#2037
legally not


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] Salat#5744
No it doesnt, it says that they dont have the right to seceede without the consent of the federal goverment


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] Murdock#2037
semantics


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
if i was the federal government i would say sure


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
which won't ever happen


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] Murdock#2037
same


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] Murdock#2037
it would help pretty much everyone


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
yeah


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
texas country would inevitably fail


[21-Jun-22 06:07 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
theyd just come crawling back


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
texans would just go full wild west


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
they can't even handle a cold winter


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
literally


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] Murdock#2037
theres absolutely no way they're actually planning on seceding in any case


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] Murdock#2037
it would be the stupidest decision in history if so


[21-Jun-22 06:08 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
real


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
I don't think walter white would be seduced by tecna


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] Murdock#2037
texas does not have the ability to function as a foreign state


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] Murdock#2037
and would immediately be taken over by mexico


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] Salat#5744
Say what you want but texas is literally the second biggest state economy


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] Murdock#2037
america will survive

Will still hurt


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
i think it would be quite funny if a state like ohio or something suceded


[21-Jun-22 06:09 AM] Salat#5744
Alaska


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] Murdock#2037
of course it'll hurt


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] Murdock#2037

[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] Murdock#2037
texas


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
canadians or nice alaska could make it


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
I think south dakota seceding would be hilarious


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
would anyone notice?


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
would north dakota just be dakota


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] Salat#5744
I mean yeah their goverment is shit


[21-Jun-22 06:10 AM] Murdock#2037
if any state should have the right to secede, it should be hawaii


[21-Jun-22 06:11 AM] TheAngryDude#0603

[21-Jun-22 06:11 AM] Salat#5744

isnt that how they make money


[21-Jun-22 06:11 AM] Murdock#2037
they'd have to build a government from the ground up


[21-Jun-22 06:11 AM] Murdock#2037

[21-Jun-22 06:12 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
utah can secede


[21-Jun-22 06:12 AM] Murdock#2037

[21-Jun-22 06:12 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
anyone but utah


[21-Jun-22 06:12 AM] Murdock#2037
if anything it'll probably give them more money


[21-Jun-22 06:12 AM] Murdock#2037
hawaii's fate sucks and they really didnt deserve to be conquered

you could use walls and stairs


[21-Jun-22 06:28 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
100 blocks big to be exact!!!

matches only last a few minutes at most


[21-Jun-22 06:30 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
i love how tanks have health points in it


[21-Jun-22 06:30 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
my reasoning for playing war thunder is that it has ships and tanks and planes in one game is somewhat more realistic and jesus fuck THEY DONT SPONSOR EVERY SINGLE FUCKING YTBER WITH AN OFFER CODE


[21-Jun-22 06:31 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

@Ieatplastic_420 were you the one who said they'd read stand still, stay silent


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
idk


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
its all gone now


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
isnt it weird that read and read are spelled the same like what if you read read but you had actually read read


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] √üupp#2372
yeah


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] √üupp#2372
confusing


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
thats just english for you


[21-Jun-22 06:42 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
though thought ought could would should


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] Murdock#2037
holy shit thats why we need to make it spelt red


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
reed


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
that's a color


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
reed like the plant


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
make them speleld the same


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
because theyre pronounced the same


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] TheAngryDude#0603
red like the weezer album


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] Murdock#2037
it is less likely for red to come up in that context


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] Murdock#2037
while read and read are both contextually similar


[21-Jun-22 06:43 AM] workingonaname#2467
red like the ted hughes poem


[21-Jun-22 06:44 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
hey guys what if you read red but you actually red read

The original upload has been made private and aside from that, it appears that snakelover23's entire channel is not accessible anymore.
Because of these facts, I have decided to reupload a video in order to prevent it from becoming lost.

I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain

"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."

[21-Jun-22 07:30 AM] Murdock#2037
I cant sit down and read, I have an unbridled driving action to do something else as soon as I open a book

Happening to me as j was reading 1984


[21-Jun-22 07:33 AM] Murdock#2037
the sand lore is very crucial to the book


[21-Jun-22 07:33 AM] Murdock#2037
you are devastated to have been spoiled


[21-Jun-22 07:33 AM] Murdock#2037
now you need to read all of dune to see the rest of the sand lore


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Murdock#2037
I cant read books but webcomics are easy


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Murdock#2037
pictures keep me glued


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
ive only seen the film acutally


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
i would read books but a


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] workingonaname#2467
The only book I read is Why Nations Fail


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Murdock#2037
the film is, not fantastic


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
wtf


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Murdock#2037
its good if you've read the book


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
i really liked it tbh


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Murdock#2037
they dont explain anything in the film


[21-Jun-22 07:34 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
in medias res

also I dont like that they changed the fremen's dream


[21-Jun-22 07:35 AM] Murdock#2037
one of my favourite parts of the first book was cut


[21-Jun-22 07:36 AM] Murdock#2037
in da movie they are like "da trees are so cool, we love trees. they symbolize our dreams!"


[21-Jun-22 07:36 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
i knew about the books before seeing film but i would probably not like it as much if iread it


[21-Jun-22 07:36 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
lotr books and film are both somewhat equal


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
one of the rare cases


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Murdock#2037
the book very much sets up the fact that water is a super fucking crucial resource


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Murdock#2037
much better than the movie


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] workingonaname#2467
we should add the cat emotes from ascendancy here


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
yeah


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] workingonaname#2467
That was ascendbots 2nd best feature


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
i think the film just goes


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
"eh its like a desretr they know water is hard to get"


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Murdock#2037
I really want to make examples and points but it would be spoiling


[21-Jun-22 07:37 AM] Murdock#2037
waaa


[21-Jun-22 07:38 AM] Murdock#2037
in the book the trees are still present


[21-Jun-22 07:38 AM] Startshow#1999
Lord of TGF movie when?


[21-Jun-22 07:38 AM] Murdock#2037
but they're a sign of the disconnect between the fremen and harkonnens

after breaking tgf season 2 comes out


[21-Jun-22 07:38 AM] Murdock#2037
the fremen dispise the trees because they see them as a gigantic waste of water


[21-Jun-22 07:38 AM] Galstera#9999
breaking tgf season 3 (comming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)


[21-Jun-22 07:39 AM] Murdock#2037
one of my favourite ways that frank sets up the importance of water in the books is that its not measured in gallons or litres


[21-Jun-22 07:39 AM] Murdock#2037
its measured in people


[21-Jun-22 07:39 AM] Startshow#1999
Who plays gus in breaking TGF season 2?


[21-Jun-22 07:39 AM] Murdock#2037
how many men can that much water sustain


[21-Jun-22 07:39 AM] Murdock#2037
the trees of the palace of Arakeen are 10 men each


[21-Jun-22 07:41 AM] Murdock#2037
first dune book is great but it goes down in quality swiftly

5space just showed up in the ascendancy discord out of the blue and said "Hello mr @NAR when are you going to ban @snekky (as he is a pedophile) üòÉ" and "@connor i c u" and then got mad when connor just muted both and went to sleep instead of playing the detective and having to go through multiple people to get any proof of it. Not a serious message like "hey connor you should talk to tgf mods about this whole snekky situation" or anything. No just a message that could easily be interpreted as a joke in poor taste and then gets mad when not taken seriously. üñï üñï üñï

does your piss smell like diabetes


[21-Jun-22 10:39 AM] flushed#1337
i mean honey


[21-Jun-22 10:39 AM] flushed#1337
cuz that‚Äôs like the number one indicator


[21-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
diabetes piss smell


[21-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
well I dont have any of the other listed symptoms and I wouldnt particularly call it honey


[21-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
or even that sweet


[21-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
just, not bad smelling


[21-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
which is weird for something from inside your body


[21-Jun-22 10:41 AM] Murdock#2037

isn't gnosticingm Christians but more gods


[21-Jun-22 10:43 AM] Murdock#2037
no dont think so


[21-Jun-22 10:43 AM] Murdock#2037
Im pretty sure they're heretical


[21-Jun-22 10:44 AM] Murdock#2037
but thats about as much as I know about them


[21-Jun-22 10:44 AM] flushed#1337
no


[21-Jun-22 10:44 AM] flushed#1337
basically


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
it posits that god is an egotistical fool who is actually an accident by higher powers


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
and that the world was made to suffer because he‚Äôs flawed


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] Murdock#2037
god is made by a higher power?


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
basically


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] Murdock#2037
the highest power has a higher power


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
i have a funni meme explains it


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] summers#0577
old testament God be like


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
well god thinks he‚Äôs the highest power


[21-Jun-22 10:45 AM] flushed#1337
but he‚Äôs really more of a shit than anything


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] Murdock#2037
well this just sounds like some anti-christian schism bullshit


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] flushed#1337
i mean


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] Murdock#2037
first century motherfuckers


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] Murdock#2037
you are mean


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] flushed#1337
yeah but it‚Äôs funni


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] Murdock#2037
I can see why they were deemed Heretical


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] flushed#1337
because it basically says the snake in the garden of eden was jesus


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] flushed#1337
and eating the apple was good because it showed humans the truth


[21-Jun-22 10:46 AM] flushed#1337
it‚Äôs complicated


[21-Jun-22 10:47 AM] Murdock#2037
its heretical


[21-Jun-22 10:47 AM] summers#0577
that actually sounds logical


[21-Jun-22 10:47 AM] Murdock#2037
human hubris was the consumption of the apple


[21-Jun-22 10:47 AM] Murdock#2037
faith in god was the highest loyalty


[21-Jun-22 10:48 AM] Murdock#2037
to want to know the truth of god is to say that you do not already believe him

American education vastly varies depending on the city/county/area you live in


[21-Jun-22 02:45 PM] haha yes#0921
and whether you go to a private school or not


[21-Jun-22 02:46 PM] haha yes#0921
my local high school sucks but the private high school I went to was decent


[21-Jun-22 02:46 PM] Salt#5507
public schools can have the same or even higher levels of academics as private schools


[21-Jun-22 02:47 PM] Salt#5507
though admittedly those public schools tend to be in neighborhoods that are typically more middle or upper middle class

American education still is the same everywhere
Although I absolutely hate that they give us some lessons where we do the learning ourselves,
combined with getting paid among other things, it encourages you to actually learn not memorise.
Plus multiple choice tests suck.


[21-Jun-22 02:52 PM] Salt#5507
multiple choice sucks?


[21-Jun-22 02:52 PM] Salt#5507
have you ever had an essay test


[21-Jun-22 02:52 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
do the uk edu system for 16 years and you will think different about the last one


[21-Jun-22 02:53 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
we have about 180 hours worth of exams in a single school year


[21-Jun-22 02:53 PM] mielle#0001
i love multiple choice you have a 1/4 chance of being correct

in which only science and maths have mutli choice questions, but they are only worth like 1 mark and there's not even many of them


[21-Jun-22 02:54 PM] Salt#5507
yea if you have basic knowledge you can usually remove one or two answers easily and get it to be 50/50


[21-Jun-22 02:54 PM] Comikaze#7822
and those schtewpid school uniforms


[21-Jun-22 02:54 PM] Comikaze#7822

[21-Jun-22 02:54 PM] Salt#5507
I will take multiple choice questions any day over written responses


[21-Jun-22 02:55 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
esp when it hits like 28c and we are wearing black trousers, black shoes/socks, black blazer and a long sleeve shirts


[21-Jun-22 02:55 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
so will i


[21-Jun-22 02:55 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
in english, our entire responses could be taken from about a thousand words to about a hundred


[21-Jun-22 02:56 PM] Ieatplastic_420#8470
we have to write so much "the writer does our could or may or connotes or implies"


[21-Jun-22 02:56 PM] Salt#5507
the ACT's science section is so funny because it doesn't require any scientific knowledge at all


[21-Jun-22 02:56 PM] Salt#5507
it's literally all data analysis


[21-Jun-22 03:00 PM] Solar Awe#1543

2.3 inches is a lot... way too much honestly. i think 1 inch, or even a half of an inch is more than enough. plus then the boots would have a great personality

@walb


[21-Jun-22 08:57 PM] RuanauR#7900
So all you need is one single 1.3GB file full of zeroes, compress that into a ZIP file, make 10 copies, pack those into a ZIP file, and repeat this process 9 times.

This way, you get a file which, when uncompressed completely, produces an absurd amount of data without requiring you to start out with that amount.

Additionally, the nested archives make it much harder for programs like virus scanners (the main target of these "bombs") to be smart and refuse to unpack archives that are "too large", because until the last level the total amount of data is not that much, you don't "see" how large the files at the lowest level are until you have reached that level, and each individual file is not "too large" - only the huge number is problematic.

i kept calling out the mods on being biased despite asking to be treated as peers


[21-Jun-22 08:59 PM] Walbert#9196
especially because a lot of the mods tried entering debates and lording their power


[21-Jun-22 09:00 PM] Walbert#9196

what's a yottabyte


[21-Jun-22 09:23 PM] RuanauR#7900
1000 eza bytes


[21-Jun-22 09:23 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
like 1,000,000,000,000,000 gigabytes


[21-Jun-22 09:24 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
no its 1000 zetabytes


[21-Jun-22 09:24 PM] OGBUBBY#1000
byte < kilo < mega < giga < tera < peta < exa <zeta <yota


[21-Jun-22 09:25 PM] summers#0577
that must be alot of stuff


[21-Jun-22 09:26 PM] summers#0577
I wonder if there's any yottabytes out there


[21-Jun-22 09:28 PM] 5space#8508
I've heard google has about 15 exabytes


[21-Jun-22 09:28 PM] RuanauR#7900
It woult take a zotabyte to store your mom


[21-Jun-22 09:28 PM] 5space#8508
A yottabyte is 1 million exabytes


[21-Jun-22 09:28 PM] summers#0577
wow


[21-Jun-22 09:28 PM] summers#0577
how many copies of war zone is that though


[21-Jun-22 09:29 PM] 5space#8508
3


[21-Jun-22 09:29 PM] RuanauR#7900
1.5


[21-Jun-22 09:37 PM] SL#9035
like 9 maybe?


[21-Jun-22 09:39 PM] Wtnautical#8826
Large hospitals tracking heart data, drug use/storage, security cameras, equipment logs, scans, plus office and research data, staff data, security door logs etc generate about 2 terabytes per day. This is 0.0000000002% of a yottabyte


[21-Jun-22 09:40 PM] Wtnautical#8826
For context of size


[21-Jun-22 09:41 PM] summers#0577
I mean I doubt they keep all those terabytes for over a year


[21-Jun-22 09:41 PM] RuanauR#7900
What does the entire worlds storage equal to


[21-Jun-22 09:41 PM] Solar Awe#1543
doesnt discord have like 16 petabytes of data


[21-Jun-22 09:41 PM] Wtnautical#8826
No they normally get wiped every week, though it depends on the hospital and some storage is permanent


[21-Jun-22 09:41 PM] summers#0577
well yeah


[21-Jun-22 09:42 PM] Solar Awe#1543
and just linus tech tips has like 3pb


[21-Jun-22 09:42 PM] summers#0577
YEAH


[21-Jun-22 09:42 PM] RuanauR#7900
?


[21-Jun-22 09:42 PM] summers#0577
if LLT has it its probaly not THAT shocking


[21-Jun-22 09:43 PM] Wtnautical#8826
59 zettabytes as of 2020, or 5.7% of a single yottabyte


[21-Jun-22 09:43 PM] RuanauR#7900
zamn


[21-Jun-22 09:44 PM] summers#0577
why don't we have ridiculous amounts of storage


[21-Jun-22 09:44 PM] Wtnautical#8826
That is a ridiculous amount of storage

[21-Jun-22 09:44 PM] summers#0577
this is the fault of Big Storage


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] Wtnautical#8826
Just get 20 10TB ones?


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] Wtnautical#8826
/s


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] summers#0577
they are hindering human evolution by not allowing me to store ridiculous amounts of data


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
summers what information are you trying to store


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] Wtnautical#8826
Largest SSD is apparently 100TB


[21-Jun-22 09:45 PM] summers#0577
ridiculous amounts of minecraft mods


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
run every minecraft mod at once


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] summers#0577
WHY IS MY SSD ONLY 220GB THEN


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] Wtnautical#8826
$40 000 for a 100TB SSD


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] Wtnautical#8826
USD that is


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] Wtnautical#8826
So if you have 40K feel free


[21-Jun-22 09:46 PM] summers#0577
it's not about the use it's about the power I feel from having so much storage


[21-Jun-22 09:47 PM] Wtnautical#8826
I see


[21-Jun-22 09:47 PM] Wtnautical#8826
I mean I got a 1 or 2 TB SSD (don‚Äôt remember which) cause I figured that was enough for me in an actual computer


[21-Jun-22 09:47 PM] Wtnautical#8826
I use external for the rest

way less effective

and


[22-Jun-22 03:59 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
probably harder

[22-Jun-22 06:15 AM] Dangerous8eans#0875

[22-Jun-22 06:16 AM] Dangerous8eans#0875
Places like tge attract the complete opposites of people to one place, it's always fascinating to watch


[22-Jun-22 06:17 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

okay so


[22-Jun-22 06:21 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
it all started when tge was officially announced to be more than just soontm


[22-Jun-22 06:22 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
i had recently started a town on the 1.16 survival server

[22-Jun-22 06:22 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
so i turned the communist mermaid town into a solo base

[22-Jun-22 06:22 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984

[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and i started trying to recruit people to join my town for when earth started


[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
but nobody would join

[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
as in people rollplaying as a cult


[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] Cheese_Addict#3663
thats kinda nice


[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] Dangerous8eans#0875
Obamium was a cult at some point


[22-Jun-22 06:23 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and they needed a town to join


[22-Jun-22 06:24 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
so i was like hey i have a town that needs members


[22-Jun-22 06:24 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and they were like awesome ill join


[22-Jun-22 06:24 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
so we settled in hawaii


[22-Jun-22 06:24 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
(i was the first person to cross the worldborder to the other side on tge btw)


[22-Jun-22 06:24 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and since there was a volcano we got raided to hell because those were valuable


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
so i looked up the map tge used and found the place the nearest unocciupied place that had tons of diamonds


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and we settled there and got REALLY rich


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
it was in austrailia


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
until some people from a bigger faction came along


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
it was like ferrari and people like him


[22-Jun-22 06:25 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and THEY STOLE OUR ROOFS

yeah


[22-Jun-22 06:26 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
we had a cult building


[22-Jun-22 06:26 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
with a fancy roof for human sacrifices


[22-Jun-22 06:26 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and so most of the members of the town kinda gave up


[22-Jun-22 06:26 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
so it was just me and the cult leader guy trying to rebuild

the event could be done in like an hour but DRAGONAM is SLEEPING so i cant get CONFIRMATION that my EVENT ITEMS are OK and not DANGEROUSLY OVERPOWERED or CONTRADICTORY TO OTHER PLANNED EVENTS which MAY OR MAY NOT exist


[22-Jun-22 06:47 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
an event tool should be slightly better than a nr gtool right

which includes PTSD and concussive trauma


[22-Jun-22 09:12 AM] Murdock#2037
which i'd say is, unlikely


[22-Jun-22 09:12 AM] summers#0577

[22-Jun-22 09:12 AM] summers#0577
melting in their brain


[22-Jun-22 09:13 AM] Murdock#2037
ADHD, autism, depressive tendencies, PTSD, anxiety and concussive trauma

what does concussive trauma mean


[22-Jun-22 09:13 AM] Murdock#2037
I do not feel like I have all those


[22-Jun-22 09:13 AM] Biotic#5170
you probably just forgot about concussive trauma because of the concussive trauma tbh


[22-Jun-22 09:13 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
A concussion


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] Murdock#2037
I have experienced a concussion that has caused my existing problems to become much worse


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
Is concussive trauma


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] Murdock#2037
namely ADHD


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] summers#0577
I thought concussions jut make you forgor


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] Murdock#2037
concussions can do a hell of a lot


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
No it can cause bad studf


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
Because it's brain


[22-Jun-22 09:14 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
You could literally die by being bonked the wrong way


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] summers#0577
brains are so mid tbh


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] Murdock#2037
the PTSD and concussion is mild and should go away by themselves just with getting better with my bike


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] Murdock#2037
got them from the crash


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] theradrad19#4849

[22-Jun-22 09:16 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
Oh was your crash like against a car


[22-Jun-22 09:16 AM] Murdock#2037
holy shit so many situations on the road could be a crash if even a few seconds are changed


[22-Jun-22 09:16 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
Because I've seen one happened and the guy was left with a broken arm


[22-Jun-22 09:16 AM] Murdock#2037
was driving home on my bike when someone sped out of their driveway and basically tboned me with their rear lights

[22-Jun-22 09:17 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
The most pain I've experienced is having my foot be run over by a motorcycle


[22-Jun-22 09:17 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
Which did not do anything


[22-Jun-22 09:18 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603

[22-Jun-22 09:18 AM] Murdock#2037
I came out really good in the crash physically


[22-Jun-22 09:18 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
I've been crushed by a damn wardrobe when I was 5 and I have still not gotten a broken bone


[22-Jun-22 09:18 AM] Murdock#2037
just had to keep my arm in a sling for a few weeks


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
The most I've got was a sprain


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] summers#0577
I bet u r a milk drinker


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] emerald#2123
how did that happen


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] Murdock#2037
spraining your ankle is apparently worse than breaking a bone


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
I swung on the door of the wardrobe and the weight was too much so it fell down


[22-Jun-22 09:19 AM] Murdock#2037
thats why you nail everything to the floor


[22-Jun-22 09:20 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603
I drank like two cups of milk with an immunity powder


[22-Jun-22 09:20 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603

[22-Jun-22 09:20 AM] TheCounterWolf#6603

[22-Jun-22 10:58 AM] Pixela#2609
we've always had private options available

rofcofot creates illness just like in metal gear rising reveancgde


[22-Jun-22 10:58 AM] Pixela#2609
and the conservatives are trying to privatise the current socialised healthcare system we have


[22-Jun-22 10:58 AM] Biotic#5170
it has private healthcare companies but the nhs is more available and generally (much) less expensive

[22-Jun-22 10:59 AM] Biotic#5170
but with private healthcare you USUALLY get quicker/sometimes better quality treatment


[22-Jun-22 10:59 AM] theradrad19#4849
yeag this is a pretty reasonable excuse to be self diagnosing or not go to the doctor for a diagnosis

100% of people that dont see a doctor are never diagnosed with an illness.

the government has been screwing the nhs to break public trust and faith in the nhs and then the government will put out a vote to remove it and it will win because people now hate the nhs

[22-Jun-22 11:46 AM] Murdock#2037
incest but like, worse because its not even a sibling


[22-Jun-22 11:46 AM] Murdock#2037
its just, you


[22-Jun-22 11:46 AM] √üupp#2372
Super incest


[22-Jun-22 11:47 AM] NotJosh#2000
from a genetics standpoint I would think it's extremely bad


[22-Jun-22 11:47 AM] NotJosh#2000
there's no dominant gene to override any negative recessive traits


[22-Jun-22 11:48 AM] Pixela#2609
whole woman as opposed to a half woman?


[22-Jun-22 11:48 AM] NotJosh#2000
imagine it's a son lmao


[22-Jun-22 11:48 AM] flushed#1337
incest only starts causing major negative effects after several generations

[22-Jun-22 11:49 AM] Biotic#5170
surely


[22-Jun-22 11:49 AM] Murdock#2037
yeah like there literally isnt any genetic diversity


[22-Jun-22 11:49 AM] Murdock#2037
its just you


[22-Jun-22 11:49 AM] NotJosh#2000

you are mean


[22-Jun-22 11:50 AM] NotJosh#2000
the egg cell still goes through meiosis right?


[22-Jun-22 11:50 AM] NotJosh#2000
that's some level of genetic diversity


[22-Jun-22 11:50 AM] Murdock#2037
yeah but nowhere near enough


[22-Jun-22 11:50 AM] NotJosh#2000
i guess, yeah

[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Murdock#2037
not really incest


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Murdock#2037
i'd be, quasi-cloning


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Biotic#5170
no because its all sourced from the same gene pool


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Murdock#2037
random mutation can still add in some form of diversity


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Biotic#5170
about half the genes would have 2 identical alleles


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Murdock#2037
true


[22-Jun-22 11:51 AM] Biotic#5170
at like 2 base pairs per century

once you find out about it you can either help create it or do nothing

[22-Jun-22 03:04 PM] dragonam#8155
those type of people CANNOT be real


[22-Jun-22 03:05 PM] dragonam#8155
why do they exist


[22-Jun-22 03:05 PM] 5space#8508

[22-Jun-22 03:05 PM] dragonam#8155

[22-Jun-22 03:05 PM] dragonam#8155
men are so competitive for no reason


[22-Jun-22 03:05 PM] haha yes#0921

describing toxic masculinity while also denying that toxic masculinity exists


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
like it just undermines valid points about problems men face in society


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] dragonam#8155
we need to make this a facebook post


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] dragonam#8155
jesus was canonically a gay trans man


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
canon


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
mfw Fox News says that toxic masculinity means that being masculine is toxic


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
THATS NOT WHAT IT MEANS


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] haha yes#0921
i messed with him for a bit, said <his old account> calm down dude and then banned him


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] 5space#8508
tbf the term toxic masculinity is actually awful for people who don't know what it means


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
true


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] haha yes#0921
funny stuff


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
the wording is


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
slightly flawed


[22-Jun-22 03:06 PM] 5space#8508
they see the term and understandably assume that people are attacking the idea of being masculine


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
oh u like fishing? toxic mf


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
yeah but if u actually look at the definition it‚Äôs straight facts


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] Natrexin#4330
So wait if you go to the gym in Fox News POV it‚Äôs toxic masculinity?


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
just a bad name


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] dragonam#8155
i love missing with homophobic people etc but i also feel bad because i feel liek they just werent raised right


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
is fishing even masculine


[22-Jun-22 03:07 PM] Cheese_Addict#3663
ive never gone fishing and im hypermasculine so probably not

Good Evening Twitter, this is your boy EatDatPussy445, and about like 30-45 minutes ago, I beat the fuck out of my dick so god damn hard that I can't even feel my left leg, my left leg has went totally numb. And, my dick has also went totally numb, to the point that it feels fucking weird when I go and take a piss.

And pipbombs are simple sealed pipe with explosive + detonator = pipebomb

[23-Jun-22 07:27 PM] muzak23#7040
A lot of misunderstanding in that video, kinda hate how everyone keeps spreading info about the change when they actually have no idea how it works :)


[23-Jun-22 07:29 PM] muzak23#7040
that video isn't the worst i've seen, but it is annoying


[23-Jun-22 07:30 PM] muzak23#7040
i don't feel like writing a whole big thing about it again but in summary the reporting likely won't work on most servers, and servers and players will be able to easily disable it (unless the server specifically makes it so players can't disable it)


[23-Jun-22 07:30 PM] muzak23#7040
so i don't think tgf would be at risk at all


[23-Jun-22 07:30 PM] muzak23#7040
and if that's all you play, you have nothing to worry about


[23-Jun-22 07:30 PM] muzak23#7040
also the systems for the signed chat messages has already been added, its not new. the reporting is new however


[23-Jun-22 07:32 PM] theradrad19#4849
is it possible to report bedrockies


[23-Jun-22 07:33 PM] muzak23#7040
no


[23-Jun-22 07:33 PM] muzak23#7040
if you are also on bedrock idk


[23-Jun-22 07:34 PM] RuanauR#7900
if yur on badrock go away


[23-Jun-22 07:35 PM] muzak23#7040

[23-Jun-22 07:35 PM] muzak23#7040
is tgf using a proxy now? i can't remember


[23-Jun-22 07:35 PM] muzak23#7040
if so, geyser won't cause lag


[23-Jun-22 07:36 PM] RuanauR#7900

[23-Jun-22 07:37 PM] muzak23#7040
im not even going to pretend that was funny


[23-Jun-22 07:38 PM] muzak23#7040
hm that'd be interesting to have the reporting system set up where only server moderators/admins could report players


[23-Jun-22 07:38 PM] haha yes#0921
there's a mod that disables the report system


[23-Jun-22 07:38 PM] haha yes#0921
it can be installed client and server side


[23-Jun-22 07:38 PM] muzak23#7040
still would be abuseable but can't say i wouldn't like that for my own use when really annoying people exist


[23-Jun-22 07:38 PM] muzak23#7040
yep i know


[23-Jun-22 07:39 PM] muzak23#7040

Time is either in an inappropriate location, which must be either at the end or beginning of your input, or I just flat out did not understand what you meant. Sorry.

I‚Äôm not actually gay the rainbow is just there for pride month


[24-Jun-22 12:58 AM] dragonam#8155
lana del rey fans are homophobic???


[24-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Cheese_Addict#3663
idk lana just looks homophobic


[24-Jun-22 01:00 AM] dragonam#8155
yasss


[24-Jun-22 01:01 AM] NotJosh#2000
Minecraft legends looks bad


[24-Jun-22 01:02 AM] NotJosh#2000
I don‚Äôt even mean this as biased hate


[24-Jun-22 01:02 AM] Cheese_Addict#3663
there aren‚Äôt any good mc spin-offs


[24-Jun-22 01:02 AM] Cheese_Addict#3663
i expect nothin g


[24-Jun-22 01:02 AM] NotJosh#2000
It looks like the most bland and generic thing they could make


[24-Jun-22 01:02 AM] NotJosh#2000
First minecraft dungeons and now this


[24-Jun-22 01:03 AM] haha yes#0921
mojang taking L after L


[24-Jun-22 01:03 AM] NotJosh#2000
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to spin into every genre and failing instead of trying to put actual effort into the main game


[24-Jun-22 01:03 AM] NotJosh#2000
The last few Minecraft updates have kinda sucked ngl


[24-Jun-22 01:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yea


[24-Jun-22 01:04 AM] NotJosh#2000
Mojang is having a hard time keeping promises, with things like fireflies and birch forests


[24-Jun-22 01:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
only 1.17 was mildly interesting to me because now you can fortune iron and gold


[24-Jun-22 01:04 AM] NotJosh#2000
yeah


[24-Jun-22 01:04 AM] haha yes#0921
me running an auto report mod on hypixel to flood the report system


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
1.16 though
1.16 was great


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] NotJosh#2000
I don‚Äôt mean to hate on Minecraft, I love the game, it‚Äôs just that Mojang really needs to do better


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] haha yes#0921
1.17 and 1.18 both sucked


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
complete overhaul of nether generation + netherite


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] haha yes#0921
because


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
true


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] haha yes#0921
it was a decent update


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] NotJosh#2000
1.16 was the best update ever


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] haha yes#0921
the cave update was a good update


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] haha yes#0921
but it was 2 updates


[24-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
^


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] NotJosh#2000
Netherite was maybe the best addition to the game since cobblestone


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] Solar Awe#1543
meanwhile terraria fans dying because the devs can't stop adding content lmaoo


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] haha yes#0921
didnt terraria have a last update


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] Solar Awe#1543
i actually predict 1.4.4 to content spiral into 1.5 at this point


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] haha yes#0921
like a year ago


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[24-Jun-22 01:06 AM] haha yes#0921
wtf are they doing then

[24-Jun-22 01:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543
also calamity 1.4 dropped today


[24-Jun-22 01:07 AM] NotJosh#2000
This is a crazy idea but I wish a part of the modding community got a hold of Minecraft source code and started making their own updates


[24-Jun-22 01:07 AM] NotJosh#2000
It would be absolutely insane, but also very interesting imo


[24-Jun-22 01:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543
you should try the calamity mod for terraria


[24-Jun-22 01:08 AM] Solar Awe#1543
calamity 2 for 1.4 dropped today and it does this to the menu

[24-Jun-22 02:15 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I was sitting in my room drawing something in the dark


[24-Jun-22 02:15 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
And i couldnt see at first


[24-Jun-22 02:16 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
But a massive baby roach walked right over my phone and because of the way my phone was in the light i had a perfect sight of it


[24-Jun-22 02:16 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I normally have a very clean room, but combined with guests in the guest room and the fact there was a party at my house a few days ago and i just didnt get rid of a few coke cans


[24-Jun-22 02:17 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I think i fucked myself over


[24-Jun-22 02:17 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I should have realized the downstairs already has roaches and shit so keeping clean upstairs is like top priority


[24-Jun-22 02:17 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
Its a good thing i have a plan


[24-Jun-22 02:18 AM] hairyasshole#9590
gas the roach


[24-Jun-22 02:18 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I am taking a ton of coke bottles, putting bleach and roach spray in them, and then just leaving them in my room (with maybe a few roach motels)


[24-Jun-22 02:18 AM] hairyasshole#9590
I gassed like 4 flies in my room today


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I usually use soda or juice with bleach and shit in it


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] dragonam#8155
roaches in florida


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
It takes a bit longer but it works


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] dragonam#8155
‚òπÔ∏è


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
My parents bought an rv when i was very young and it was FILLED with roaches


[24-Jun-22 02:19 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
When i opened the fridge once a roach jumped on my hand


[24-Jun-22 02:20 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I cant stand them now


[24-Jun-22 02:20 AM] dragonam#8155
no fucking way


[24-Jun-22 02:20 AM] dragonam#8155
experiencing roaches in florida when i was younger definitely caused my bug phobia shit


[24-Jun-22 02:20 AM] hairyasshole#9590
I‚Äôve only seen a roach once and it was in the middle school library


[24-Jun-22 02:21 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
Roaches defined how i look at any bug that slightly resembles it


[24-Jun-22 02:21 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I cant look at roaches, palmettos, some beetles, etc. without extreme hatred


[24-Jun-22 02:21 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I have seen so many


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] hairyasshole#9590
I‚Äôve dealt with mice and spiders


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I think its just a thing in florida to live with one or two roaches every once in a while since they are everywhere


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
Never seen a mouse, love spiders


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] hairyasshole#9590
I fucking hate wasps


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] hairyasshole#9590
there were 4 of them in my garage


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] 5space#8508
jesse we need to cook


[24-Jun-22 02:22 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
I like wasps, they don‚Äôt bother me for whatever reason


[24-Jun-22 02:23 AM] hairyasshole#9590
I‚Äôm fine with bees


[24-Jun-22 02:23 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629

[24-Jun-22 02:24 AM] 5space#8508

Then i say whatever i need to say, get response, and jump into another game, finish a round, and then go back into the conversation


[24-Jun-22 02:49 AM] ovalgoatkid#9629
Then while i play i can think of a good response

what % of players in your estimate knows not to open a trapped chest when they see one


[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
is it to mean to make them just instantly explode you if somebody is dumb enough to open one


[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] dti131#8960
20?


[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] dti131#8960

[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] dti131#8960
Not actual traps


[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] dti131#8960
I‚Äôd open one if I knew it wasn‚Äôt a trap


[24-Jun-22 09:22 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
in the context of an event where everything is trying to kill you


[24-Jun-22 09:23 AM] Pixela#2609
if they recognise it as one they probably won't open it


[24-Jun-22 09:23 AM] dti131#8960
Ah then probably 60%


[24-Jun-22 09:23 AM] theradrad19#4849
100%


[24-Jun-22 09:23 AM] Pixela#2609
it's just a case of whether or not they notice that it's trapped or not

[24-Jun-22 11:32 AM] √üupp#2372

[24-Jun-22 11:33 AM] Xenogenix#9300

[24-Jun-22 11:35 AM] Xenogenix#9300
I‚Äôve seen a few people in tv shows call their mom mother


[24-Jun-22 11:35 AM] Xenogenix#9300
No real people


[24-Jun-22 11:35 AM] emerald#2123

If that's true then what does that make the best person at your school? Someone who hangs out with a bad person? I don't think so.

cheating is always morally correct because the school system is stupid anyway

Morals are subjective


[24-Jun-22 12:24 PM] Salat#5744
So if you decide whatever you decide to do isnt morally wrong


[24-Jun-22 12:24 PM] Salat#5744
Its not


[24-Jun-22 12:24 PM] summers#0577
honesty isn't a school subject so I don't feel bad


[24-Jun-22 12:24 PM] sprout#6906

ok, I lied. I actually did the math and it comes back because I designed the main stage to fall back into the ocean (with airbrakes and parachutes so it's safe) and you can see this with the thin WHITE trajectory. *not the blue one!*

however, the satellite separates with enough inertia to escape the Earth sphere of influence, and get's pulled into a solar orbit similar to Earth's orbit

Also I ran out of data. I still get low speed data though. It allows me to barely use discord (if it‚Äôs fully loaded beforehand) and Twitter for some reason. Think Spotify might work aswell.

[24-Jun-22 10:37 PM] summers#0577
like what does it do


[24-Jun-22 10:38 PM] emerald#2123
iphone + watch


[24-Jun-22 10:39 PM] Galstera#9999
see
basically useless...


[24-Jun-22 10:39 PM] summers#0577
so iPhone + thing iPhone already does?


[24-Jun-22 10:42 PM] emerald#2123
do you have iphone on your wrist?


[24-Jun-22 10:47 PM] summers#0577
you can have iPhone in your pocket


[24-Jun-22 10:47 PM] summers#0577
in my opinion just as practical


[24-Jun-22 10:47 PM] emerald#2123
what if somebody shot you in the pocket and it broke


[24-Jun-22 10:47 PM] emerald#2123
what then?


[24-Jun-22 10:49 PM] summers#0577
what


[24-Jun-22 10:50 PM] emerald#2123
what if somebody tried to shoot you in the leg but it hit your pocket and the iphone broke


[24-Jun-22 10:50 PM] emerald#2123
then you have no iphone


[24-Jun-22 10:50 PM] emerald#2123
so an apple watch would be a good idea then

[25-Jun-22 01:24 AM] NotJosh#2000
I fucking hate republicans/conservatives. They feel they have the right to impose the Bible upon other people in the form of laws (such as overturning Roe V. Wade) and ignore the US citizen‚Äôs right to exist free of religion. Somehow they don‚Äôt understand that most people don‚Äôt believe in their religion yet they somehow can‚Äôt comprehend the simple idea of leaving people alone. There‚Äôs also the undeniable hypocrisy that exists for denying the rights to abortion, in which they believe that an 11 year old girl is mature enough to give birth in the case of a rape, but isn‚Äôt mature enough to see a 2-frame same-sex kiss (Lightyear). The amount of stupidity that they have on their side is absolutely insane and I believe something need to be done to prevent the seizure of constitutional rights by the right.

I was an icewayman
Along the ice roads I did fly
With sword and radar by my side
Many a rando lost their diamonds to my raids
Many a dono lost their XP to my blade
The bastards banned me on December '29th
But I am still alive

I was a dono
With diamond armor I did ride
With Foli client I did abide
I raided randos in the streets of The Meadow
I went around to slaughter players in one blow
And when the bombs went off they said that I got killed
But I am hacking still

I was a bedrocker
I cross'd the highways far and wide
Where ice and lava did collide 
A place called hooters on the east nether highway
I griefed, then fell into the lavafields below 
They banned me quicker than my boots could hit the ground 
But my alt is still around 
It'll always be around, and around 
and around And around 
and around and around 

I'll fly an Elytra
Across the server shut' divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to store my diamonds if I can
Perhaps I may become an icewayman again
Or I'll simply try to drive the mods insane
But I will remain

And I'll come back again, and again
And again and again and again and again
And again

and i consider, that a lot


[25-Jun-22 06:07 PM] Hapho#3077
i used to take like 10 photos per shot because android cameras usually arent the most reliable


[25-Jun-22 06:07 PM] Hapho#3077

[25-Jun-22 06:08 PM] Galstera#9999

[25-Jun-22 06:08 PM] √üupp#2372

[25-Jun-22 06:08 PM] Galstera#9999
i take like 3 per shot depending on angle/quality


[25-Jun-22 06:09 PM] Hapho#3077
making sure theyre not blurry
for example, my grandmas 100 euro huawei produces blurry pictures 90% of the time


[25-Jun-22 06:09 PM] Hapho#3077

both of my 100e xiaomi phones have quite good cameras tbh


[25-Jun-22 06:11 PM] Galstera#9999

[25-Jun-22 06:11 PM] Hapho#3077

\> Claims to have precise gunplay but bullet spread becomes completely random after about 10 bullets (set spray pattern in cs = higher skill ceiling)
\> TF2s graphics look nicer ngl valorant looks kinda stinky

The SquidnessGram‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Pacer Nuke is a multistage aerobic capacity nuke that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer nuke will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The squidding speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to nuke in a straight line, and squid as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your nuke is over. The nuke will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

[27-Jun-22 09:42 AM] Biotic#5170
Cat:
 - Doesn‚Äôt care about you
 - Fucks off outside the entire day you never see it
 - Ravages local wildlife (invasive species)
Dog:
 - Loves you back \:)
 - Can be properly trained and doesn‚Äôt eat birds and stuff

The closer you are to the center of mass of an object the stronger the gravitational pull

The closer you get to the centre of the earth the  more mass is behind you

[27-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
idiots whomst think we will be colonizing other planets


[27-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Murdock#2037
(they do not know it will take millennia to arrival at the closest of the potential homes)


[27-Jun-22 10:40 AM] Galstera#9999

it will take 3 whole metric jesi to get there


[27-Jun-22 10:41 AM] summers#0577
we won't colonize any planets we will explode ourselves with nukes beforehand


[27-Jun-22 10:41 AM] Xenogenix#9300
Even if you travel at the speed of light the closest probably habitable planet will still take you hundreds of years


[27-Jun-22 10:42 AM] Murdock#2037
or the mf who want to go to mars


[27-Jun-22 10:42 AM] Murdock#2037

[27-Jun-22 10:42 AM] summers#0577

[27-Jun-22 10:42 AM] summers#0577
otherwise nothing we do is in worth it


[27-Jun-22 10:43 AM] Xenogenix#9300
Humanity is going to die on planet Earth and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it

I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

why the fuck is sin() and cos() such a big deal that optifine would bring it up


[27-Jun-22 06:44 PM] summers#0577
isn't that shit used for triangles


[27-Jun-22 06:45 PM] haha yes#0921
also i will turn the chat reporting thing into like


[27-Jun-22 06:45 PM] haha yes#0921
puss out or whatever


[27-Jun-22 06:45 PM] Biotic#5170
trig is used extensively in rendering stuff


[27-Jun-22 06:45 PM] haha yes#0921
(norman reference)


[27-Jun-22 06:45 PM] summers#0577
but minecraft is cubes not triangles


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] haha yes#0921
the cubes are made of triangles


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] summers#0577
why????


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] emerald#2123
cube triangle


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] haha yes#0921
thats how a lot of 3d modeling is done


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] Biotic#5170
yeah they should be using cube() and cocube() my bad


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] haha yes#0921
anyway if i can make opening the chat report menu crash your game i will


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] haha yes#0921
with funnypack


[27-Jun-22 06:46 PM] summers#0577
making a cube out of triangles is dumb because then you have to render more stuff than normal


[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] summers#0577
8 triangles instead of 1 cube


[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Biotic#5170
make it automatically post a slur in chat and then report yourself


[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] haha yes#0921

[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Biotic#5170
oh


[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] haha yes#0921

[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Biotic#5170
wait is it even possible to report your own message?


[27-Jun-22 06:47 PM] haha yes#0921

[27-Jun-22 06:49 PM] √üupp#2372
Is the function


[27-Jun-22 06:49 PM] Biotic#5170
the function is sin


[27-Jun-22 06:49 PM] summers#0577
what's the formula for acquiring cosine and sin


[27-Jun-22 06:49 PM] √üupp#2372
Sin


[27-Jun-22 06:49 PM] √üupp#2372

[27-Jun-22 06:50 PM] haha yes#0921
very nice


[27-Jun-22 06:50 PM] Biotic#5170
sin(x) can be approximated to x - (x^3/3!) + (x^5/5!) - (x^7/7!) + .... to infinity, im pretty sure computers use the first few terms of that to closely approximate sin


[27-Jun-22 06:50 PM] Biotic#5170
cos(x) has a similar approximation


[27-Jun-22 06:51 PM] √üupp#2372
Cosx is the opposite values


[27-Jun-22 06:51 PM] Kiwie#8014
Wtf, God approximates your sin

they probably scan it with their camera instead of through the app so it takes them to a standard discord login on browser

[27-Jun-22 08:13 PM] Biotic#5170
With triangles, you only need to specify vertex locations, whereas with any other polygons you‚Äôd also need to specify between which vertices edges connect so it‚Äôs just easier to use triangles and make everything else from that

[27-Jun-22 09:16 PM] Murdock#2037
and he absolutely wont accept the fact that I say im getting better because apparently I have no clue what I have, despite the fact its flu season, my father had the flu, I got it from my father, and its all the symptoms of the flu


[27-Jun-22 09:16 PM] Murdock#2037

omw to the bathroom right now


[28-Jun-22 05:56 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
i had a nightmare where tgf introduced a new rule called "Do not enter the steel tube unauthorized." with a 12 point penalty, and seemingly random people were getting pointed for it. but then, people realized that if they went into their bathroom there would be a- roughly 5 feet tall- metal tunnel coming from one of the walls, and somehow the mods knew when you entered it. magnar decided to stream entering the "steel tube" in vc to see what happened. when he entered the tube the bathroom disappeared behind him, leaving only an infinite tunnel in either direction. magnar started to walk in one of the directions, but suddenly salt stabbed him in the back, picked up his phone, and turned off the stream. anyone who was in the vc got pointed for "forbidden thoughts"

I wonder why 1.0 got banned üòÉ


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] Submadoge#0472
have you copyrighted it so that only you can use it


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] theradrad19#4849
no


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] theradrad19#4849
i dont think i need to


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] 5space#8508
I mean Ohio state university copyrighted the word The so


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] Submadoge#0472
i am stealing your term


[28-Jun-22 06:23 AM] cyan#2123
alternatively: shoot everyone in the head that uses it


[28-Jun-22 06:24 AM] Submadoge#0472
fucking ohio copyrighting words and shit


[28-Jun-22 06:24 AM] Murdock#2037
you need legal protection against subma

like they've got something better to do


[28-Jun-22 06:24 AM] Submadoge#0472
fuck the state of ohio


[28-Jun-22 06:25 AM] 5space#8508
They're officially called The Ohio State University to differentiate themselves from Ohio University


[28-Jun-22 06:25 AM] 5space#8508
But everyone still calls them just Ohio State University which is really funny


[28-Jun-22 06:25 AM] Submadoge#0472
people say missouri is miserable like misery and all that but we cant have it because ohio is hogging all the pain and suffering in the world for themselves

i remember him becoming mod


[28-Jun-22 07:06 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
i was only active in terraria then tho

[28-Jun-22 07:06 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and i was excited to have somebody that WASNT MARIOFOLI


[28-Jun-22 07:06 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
because mariofoli was actually trash at terraria modding


[28-Jun-22 07:06 AM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
and then a3 "leaked mod stuff" or whatever


[28-Jun-22 07:07 AM] Submadoge#0472
i think nino knows about what he actually leaked?


[28-Jun-22 07:07 AM] Murdock#2037
probably


[28-Jun-22 07:07 AM] Submadoge#0472
he never talked about it though with nino being nino


[28-Jun-22 07:07 AM] Murdock#2037
he did leak a lot of it to us


[28-Jun-22 07:07 AM] Submadoge#0472

[28-Jun-22 07:08 AM] Murdock#2037
bedbombing would be disabled is pretty much the only leak I remember

That's like going on r/hydrohomies and expecting to see someone praising coca-cola


[28-Jun-22 08:32 AM] Murdock#2037
its just really weird that they speak and think exactly like the other side does

they got the same shit

but by god some of the shit they say


[28-Jun-22 08:33 AM] Murdock#2037
like those 40 immigrants that died in texas because they got cooked in the back of a smuggling trailer

and everything they post is completely unfounded


[28-Jun-22 08:35 AM] Murdock#2037

Oil and gas live on a contract basis. If the president of the USA declares a campaign against oil and gas, then investors are going to see that, and think that it's a terrible investment, putting their money elsewhere. Gas and oil was already just... crippled from the pandemic. Then Biden shut down a very important pipeline, causing there to be less fuel. Biden also stopped dealing with Russia for gas and oil, making it even more scarce. He also is working directly against the industry, and he can do a lot of things, mostly passing bills and making more restrictions, though I haven't researched that recently.

how do you get a vape


[28-Jun-22 05:28 PM] Biotic#5170
you tell the guy that sells them that you're only 11 but he sells you them anyway


[28-Jun-22 05:28 PM] Galstera#9999
you dont


[28-Jun-22 05:29 PM] ovalgoatkid#9629
You shoot your lungs (its the faster alternative (speedrunning (dream)))


[28-Jun-22 05:29 PM] summers#0577
you dont because vapes are bad for you


[28-Jun-22 05:29 PM] Hapho#3077

Drink gum flavored tar, at least you wont have to be alive long enough to suffer terminal illness and have your friends and family suffer around your bodies slow decay

[28-Jun-22 05:35 PM] Galstera#9999
people still smoke quite a lot where i live, most if not all of my family members smoke
its just a bad thing to do, both price and effect wise, it just does nothing while only damaging your lungs


[28-Jun-22 05:35 PM] Ethan#0420

[28-Jun-22 05:36 PM] summers#0577
can you buy artificially created of that stuff


[28-Jun-22 05:36 PM] summers#0577
are labs sinthesyting it


[28-Jun-22 05:36 PM] muzak23#7040
when someone says "shooting blanks" that usually means they are an infertile male. when that happens you still have semen, there just is no sperm in it. hope that helps


[28-Jun-22 05:37 PM] muzak23#7040
artificially created sperm? that sounds pretty unlikely

QUESTION: When buying multiple of the same items at the store do you scan them each or scan one multiple times (i do each one to prevent any electrical infetterence)


[28-Jun-22 10:38 PM] Jacki#4312
ANSWER: i let the person employed to do it do it for me


[28-Jun-22 10:38 PM] Jacki#4312
put it on the conveyer belt and wait and go to the end of the line and bag the shit if theres no one there already


[28-Jun-22 10:41 PM] workingonaname#2467
Scan them all


[28-Jun-22 10:41 PM] summers#0577
self checkout is so DUMB and at the same time the smartest idea ever


[28-Jun-22 10:41 PM] Jacki#4312
true


[28-Jun-22 10:42 PM] summers#0577
it's messy and I don't know how to use it but also making the customer scan the items themselves doubling the speed is intelligent


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
wdym its messy


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
you pick up item


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
scan


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
and put in back


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
bag*


[28-Jun-22 10:43 PM] Jacki#4312
then repeat until you are done


[28-Jun-22 10:45 PM] RuanauR#7900
Same


[28-Jun-22 10:45 PM] RuanauR#7900
helps prevent any  electrical infetterence


[28-Jun-22 10:51 PM] RuanauR#7900
Is it spelled infetterence or interference


[28-Jun-22 10:53 PM] Solar Awe#1543
fixed + it's even worse on mobile

OHH


[28-Jun-22 11:30 PM] Murdock#2037
a quote of a person in the past saying that you need to halt


[28-Jun-22 11:30 PM] Murdock#2037
so its an event that needs to happen, that has happened


[28-Jun-22 11:30 PM] Murdock#2037
so I dont know what that does to the temporal case


[28-Jun-22 11:31 PM] Kiwie#8014
What r you trying to accomplish, the guidelines?


[28-Jun-22 11:31 PM] Murdock#2037

[28-Jun-22 11:32 PM] Kiwie#8014

[29-Jun-22 12:55 AM] Chephadrom#0562
The dairy people just do the same thing as grocery stockers, except they work exclusively with dairy and we aren‚Äôt allowed to touch any of their stuff


[29-Jun-22 12:56 AM] Submadoge#0472
make sure cheese addict is contained

[29-Jun-22 12:56 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
good plan


[29-Jun-22 12:56 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
he would fit in with the other blocks of cheese because he is short


[29-Jun-22 12:57 AM] Chephadrom#0562
Best part of my job is we are super short staffed for part time stockers, so managers have to be super careful to not piss any of the remaining ones off to make us leave


[29-Jun-22 12:58 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
all the people i met at hr seemed rlly nice so hopefully they‚Äôll treat us right


[29-Jun-22 12:59 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
but fucking EMILY has to call me back!


[29-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Chephadrom#0562
It‚Äôs a big enough store to have hr?


[29-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Chephadrom#0562

[29-Jun-22 12:59 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
yeah


[29-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I think the people in our customer service booth also do our hr stuff or something


[29-Jun-22 01:00 AM] CheesyBaconBits#9958
yeah that‚Äôs what i mean


[29-Jun-22 01:01 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I worked at a huge target and they had a whole dedicated hr team


[29-Jun-22 01:01 AM] Chephadrom#0562

[29-Jun-22 01:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
i somehow misread the 1 on my pings as pi


[29-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Drewand#5174
how have pi number of pings


[29-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Chephadrom#0562
œÄ


[29-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[29-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Drewand#5174
the radius of the notification correlates to the amount of pings you have


[29-Jun-22 01:06 AM] Drewand#5174
you have to solve for area


[29-Jun-22 01:06 AM] Solar Awe#1543

\>I am the part of you that you repress.

\>The part of you that you're ashamed of.

edating is dumb but using discord to find people to date is good because discord has less normal people than tinder

There's no greater rush than going as fast as you can in a vehicle.
Whatever it is, either cycling as fast as you can downhill or flooring the gas pedal in a car,
it feels so good to get a temporary distraction from your life, especially if your phone is silent and your favourite songs are filling the gaps in your mind.


[29-Jun-22 03:39 PM] summers#0577

you can launch the cheats before the anticheat starts, quite easily

The Baltics, especially Latvia, are popular countries for fleeing russians because you basically dont need any knowledge of English or our native language. Plus, ever since we joined the EU, the Baltics feel more European by the year ||(paved roads, good public transit, walkable and liveable cities, good QOL)||. This is why I chose russian in school over German.
I'm quite patriotic so I think I won't emigrate from my country or leave for work for more than a few years unless it has really gone BAD.
