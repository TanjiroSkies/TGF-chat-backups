What game servers does the server currently host?
Currently, TGForever has both a Minecraft server and a Terraria server.

Our Minecraft server is focused on a classic vanilla experience with a handful of quality-of-life upgrades, and is compatible with both Java and Bedrock editions! Use the **IP** `mc.tgforever.org` with the **bedrock port** (if applicable) `9671` to connect to it! Please note that our Minecraft server has a separate rule list from the Discord server, viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5vupqd3A2K-CiGZ9Wl5e0xdN4SgSVKwhNSIDPDGDVM/edit). All rules in #rules also still apply.

If you're looking for a challenge, some fun, some friends, or all three, the Terraria server is for you! You can join us using the **IP** `terraria.tgforever.org` on **port** `7777`.
