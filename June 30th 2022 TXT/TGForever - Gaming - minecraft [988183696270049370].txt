shit shit shit


[20-Jun-22 12:08 AM] dti131#8960
Vruhed would later punch me back, leading to him being crystalled...a worthy punishment for swearing in MC servr...


[20-Jun-22 12:39 AM] vruhed#4198
I dieded


[20-Jun-22 12:40 AM] vruhed#4198
due to my foolishness


[20-Jun-22 10:13 AM] Drewand#5174
if someone kills me and takes all my stuff (while I‚Äôm clearly afk and do not want to pvp) is there a way to report them for trolling/whatever


[20-Jun-22 10:15 AM] Drewand#5174
the person I think it is also in content team which gives the server a bad image for new people


[20-Jun-22 10:16 AM] sincererimp#1473
was it CFDL boi....


[20-Jun-22 10:20 AM] Drewand#5174
technically i cant confirm who it was, but i am 90% sure it was


[20-Jun-22 10:21 AM] sincererimp#1473
did it not say in chat


[20-Jun-22 10:21 AM] sincererimp#1473
??


[20-Jun-22 10:21 AM] Drewand#5174
i was afk


[20-Jun-22 10:22 AM] sincererimp#1473
do you have replay mo


[20-Jun-22 10:22 AM] sincererimp#1473
mod


[20-Jun-22 10:22 AM] Drewand#5174
no


[20-Jun-22 10:22 AM] sincererimp#1473
ok


[20-Jun-22 10:26 AM] LayOreo7#3411
I don‚Äôt think so, unless they griefed or glitched to get to you


[20-Jun-22 10:30 AM] Drewand#5174
i did lock myself in locked trapdoors


[20-Jun-22 10:37 AM] sincererimp#1473
then how did you die


[20-Jun-22 10:37 AM] theradrad19#4849
then report it


[20-Jun-22 10:39 AM] Drewand#5174
do i just dm a mod to report it


[20-Jun-22 10:42 AM] theradrad19#4849
dm


[20-Jun-22 10:42 AM] theradrad19#4849
i think


[20-Jun-22 11:13 AM] Joeffended#8749
drewand you are a dumbass


[20-Jun-22 11:13 AM] Joeffended#8749
you wer hiding in a 1x1 hole afk


[20-Jun-22 11:14 AM] Joeffended#8749
i didnt even bypass any protection i only shot you until you died


[20-Jun-22 11:14 AM] Joeffended#8749
and yes shooting through corners of walls is an actual feature


[20-Jun-22 11:26 AM] Drewand#5174
what did i do to you for this


[20-Jun-22 11:26 AM] Drewand#5174
this is the second time you have attacked me while afk


[20-Jun-22 11:31 AM] theradrad19#4849
bloodthirsty


[20-Jun-22 11:32 AM] Joeffended#8749
only the 2nd?


[20-Jun-22 01:26 PM] dti131#8960
the actual explanation is that it's a shitty afk spot and your hitbox wasn't in the trapdoors


[20-Jun-22 01:26 PM] dti131#8960
oh its for placing compasses in our stronghold btw


[20-Jun-22 01:27 PM] dti131#8960
when it was a private stronghold


[20-Jun-22 01:40 PM] Drewand#5174
real mature move monkey cage


[20-Jun-22 01:41 PM] Drewand#5174
living up to your name I see


[20-Jun-22 01:41 PM] Joeffended#8749
did you expect us to call the mods instead?


[20-Jun-22 01:41 PM] Joeffended#8749
we're not that petty lmfao


[20-Jun-22 01:50 PM] dti131#8960
this is why i afk in locked boxes btw


[20-Jun-22 01:50 PM] dti131#8960
pretty much no way to get into a box of barrels


[20-Jun-22 01:50 PM] dti131#8960
unless gott decides hes gonna troll me again


[20-Jun-22 01:57 PM] Salat#5744
what does that mean


[20-Jun-22 01:57 PM] dti131#8960
/kill


[20-Jun-22 01:58 PM] Salat#5744

[20-Jun-22 02:40 PM] haha yes#0921
moron


[20-Jun-22 03:01 PM] dti131#8960

[20-Jun-22 03:01 PM] haha yes#0921
OK IDC


[20-Jun-22 03:01 PM] dti131#8960
I mean he could trap my logout


[20-Jun-22 03:02 PM] Jacki#4312
when: dti131 log in
do: /kill dti131


[20-Jun-22 03:04 PM] haha yes#0921
@Salat get on it


[20-Jun-22 05:48 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
Just put kill dti131 in a repeating command block with a chain one after it destroying said command block after it successfully runs


[20-Jun-22 05:58 PM] Jacki#4312
but he could eventually just spam joins and rejoins until they‚Äôre all gone


[20-Jun-22 06:09 PM] eee–µ–µ–µ–µ–µ–µeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee#1984
This one would just kill him once btw


[20-Jun-22 06:56 PM] theradrad19#4849
why would you care


[20-Jun-22 06:56 PM] theradrad19#4849
its just a compass moron


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] dti131#8960
i dont


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] dti131#8960
im also not the one who killed him


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] theradrad19#4849
i know but you have before


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] theradrad19#4849
for the same reason most likely


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] dti131#8960
not for the compass


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] dti131#8960
i didnt even know about that


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] theradrad19#4849
then for what


[20-Jun-22 06:57 PM] dti131#8960

Ask Mojang: What happened to the fireflies in Minecraft 1.19?
Have you been wondering what the allay is based off, if goat horns and bundles are included in The Wild Update, or if we use Blockbench to build our models? You‚Äôre in luck, because we‚Äôve got answers aplenty! We also have a special message regarding questions about fireflies and birch forests being added to Minecraft, so tune in and keep sending ...

[21-Jun-22 06:22 PM] MasterSpider5#6275
This whole fireflies thing is absolutely fucking baffeling to an outsider
Like, on the one hand: It's tiny fireflies. They're pointless and removing them is so meaningless
but at the same time, *they're meaningless, why the fuck would they remove them??*


[21-Jun-22 06:23 PM] haha yes#0921
true


[21-Jun-22 06:24 PM] MasterSpider5#6275
Minecraft has really fallen off

Minecraft shit hit the fan once they stopped removing herobrine


[21-Jun-22 06:25 PM] LysFisk#6975
He really did a number on them‚Ä¶.


[21-Jun-22 06:26 PM] MasterSpider5#6275
oh for fucks sake
did they stop doing that joke in the patch notes 
whyyyyy


[21-Jun-22 06:26 PM] Salt#5507
Why not just remove the feature of frogs eating fireflies


[21-Jun-22 06:26 PM] LysFisk#6975
Because what if kids uhhhh feed herobrine to a frog


[21-Jun-22 06:27 PM] MasterSpider5#6275
WHY WAS THAT EVEN A JUSTIFICATION
FROGS EAT FIREFLIES, IT'S A NATURAL PROCESS 
A FEW CHILDREN SPEEDING IT UP (which i doubt they'd even do, when was the last time you fed a fucking frog in the wild) ISN'T GOING TO MAKE THEM EXTINCT

[21-Jun-22 06:30 PM] Salt#5507
Are they another environmental mob


[21-Jun-22 06:31 PM] LysFisk#6975
Mojang mfs didnt want to add sharks because they dont want people trying to ride sharks irl


[21-Jun-22 06:31 PM] LysFisk#6975
wth mojang thats metal af?!????


[21-Jun-22 06:32 PM] MasterSpider5#6275
If you can get close enough to a shark, you can probably ride it


[21-Jun-22 06:33 PM] haha yes#0921
they make froglights


[21-Jun-22 06:33 PM] haha yes#0921
i guess


[21-Jun-22 06:36 PM] Submadoge#0472
the feature of frogs eating fireflies is the fireflies' system 32


[21-Jun-22 06:36 PM] Jacki#4312
what the fuck is a froglight


[21-Jun-22 06:36 PM] Submadoge#0472
you delete that and the entire mob deletes itself


[21-Jun-22 06:37 PM] Submadoge#0472
you stick a torch down a frog's throat and hang it on the ceiling

WHO DELETED THE ORIGINAL TGF DISCORD? After a long and tedious search, I have discovered the true culprit. DragonAM wanted to try to hide this incriminating information from you by destroying any possible trace of it. WATCH OUT! She can and will grief your Minecraft base at any moment! You have been warned.

NEED FURTHER CONVINCING? DragonAM attempted to hide her true identity, but it leaked through‚Ä¶ that was why she had to purge the server, to satisfy her destructive impulses and to hide any potential leads. WAKE UP TGF.

6gt Raid Farm v2 [Minecraft Java 1.16-1.18.2]
The best raid farm for tech servers gets even better! (Does not work on spigot or any forks of spigot.)

Compared to the original this version has:
- Less portal slicing
- No vex suppressors
- Is snow proof
- The same rates

Rates per hour:
1.45 million items
770k emeralds
54k each witch drop
108k sticks
70k totems (unsorted)
other useless drops...

Minecraft: 1:64 Ratio Item Shop
This video shows you have to make an item shop in minecraft where you pay 1 item to receive 32 up to 2.5 stacks of some other item. Really usefull if you are making a shop where you want people to pay with valuable items and get alot of not so valuable items in return!
Oh and for some reason it sometimes gives you 31 instead of 32 but I don't t...

[24-Jun-22 11:45 AM] BlitzIR#9944
I chose this because it isn‚Äôt as resource intensive but it lacks a redstone lamp


[24-Jun-22 11:55 AM] dti131#8960
Comparator facing into the stock barrel powering a redstone lamp?


[24-Jun-22 11:56 AM] BlitzIR#9944
the stock is the dropper to the right


[24-Jun-22 11:56 AM] BlitzIR#9944
I could try doing that to the side of the dropper or something


[24-Jun-22 11:57 AM] dti131#8960
Could alternatively use @Wtnautical ‚Äòs design. Has stock light etc

[27-Jun-22 08:23 PM] Submadoge#0472

[27-Jun-22 08:23 PM] Submadoge#0472

@TecnaGamer you!


[27-Jun-22 08:25 PM] Submadoge#0472
back me up!


[27-Jun-22 08:25 PM] Submadoge#0472
yeah basically, gotta move on may not be a good one to reupload though as its more of a meme than a clip


[27-Jun-22 08:26 PM] Rocket_man1234#0772
but why did you upload them to tgm if you wanted it on the tgf social media?


[27-Jun-22 08:26 PM] Rocket_man1234#0772
I was never aware of this


[27-Jun-22 08:26 PM] Submadoge#0472
free content!


[27-Jun-22 08:27 PM] Submadoge#0472
they are tg media clips so i posted the tg media clips to the tg media channel


[27-Jun-22 08:27 PM] Submadoge#0472
but they were originally created to be posted on tgf accounts


[27-Jun-22 08:27 PM] Submadoge#0472
as per tecna's demands


[27-Jun-22 08:28 PM] Rocket_man1234#0772
Again, I was never made aware of this. I can post these if you send the files or DM me when a clip is ready


[27-Jun-22 08:29 PM] Submadoge#0472
talk to tecna about it!

[28-Jun-22 06:19 PM] haha yes#0921
@BlitzIR can i have a schematic or something like that


[28-Jun-22 06:19 PM] haha yes#0921
i could probably make you a better design


[28-Jun-22 06:19 PM] haha yes#0921
place the lamp where you want it to be and i will try to connect it


[28-Jun-22 06:19 PM] BlitzIR#9944
I gave the link to the exact tutorial I used


[28-Jun-22 06:19 PM] BlitzIR#9944
lemme find


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] haha yes#0921
do you have litematica


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] haha yes#0921
actually


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] haha yes#0921
i already showed you what i did right


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] BlitzIR#9944
Yeah but our designs weren't that similar from what I saw


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] BlitzIR#9944
sort of but not 100%


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] BlitzIR#9944
so it threw me off


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] haha yes#0921
its the same design i just added 2 droppers to it


[28-Jun-22 06:20 PM] haha yes#0921
are you using 1 dropper


[28-Jun-22 06:21 PM] BlitzIR#9944
nah 2


[28-Jun-22 06:21 PM] BlitzIR#9944
because both dispense 32


[28-Jun-22 06:21 PM] haha yes#0921
the same way i am or


[28-Jun-22 06:21 PM] haha yes#0921
the thing i did should still work

Minecraft: 1:64 Ratio Item Shop
This video shows you have to make an item shop in minecraft where you pay 1 item to receive 32 up to 2.5 stacks of some other item. Really usefull if you are making a shop where you want people to pay with valuable items and get alot of not so valuable items in return!
Oh and for some reason it sometimes gives you 31 instead of 32 but I don't t...

[28-Jun-22 06:28 PM] BlitzIR#9944
you just have to stand right in front of the hoppers so the items dont go all over the place


[28-Jun-22 06:29 PM] BlitzIR#9944
the lamps go off when the droppers are empty


[28-Jun-22 06:29 PM] BlitzIR#9944
its also one payment at a time, stacking payments do not work and dispense like 64 + 6 for a stackable item


[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] haha yes#0921
you could also do this


[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] haha yes#0921

[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] haha yes#0921
looks cleaner


[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] haha yes#0921
you can hide it


[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] haha yes#0921
and if you source both droppers from one chest like this


[28-Jun-22 06:34 PM] BlitzIR#9944
Does the lamp serve as the stock for both droppers or just one


[28-Jun-22 06:35 PM] haha yes#0921
just one but its easier to split the contents of a double chest like this


[28-Jun-22 06:35 PM] haha yes#0921
but youd need to make sure you put the items into one double chest and split them


[28-Jun-22 06:35 PM] BlitzIR#9944
yeah mine is janky af


[28-Jun-22 06:35 PM] haha yes#0921
add more hoppers as necessary


[28-Jun-22 06:35 PM] haha yes#0921
actually


[28-Jun-22 06:36 PM] haha yes#0921
youd need to move around that redstone dust

[28-Jun-22 06:39 PM] haha yes#0921
it would look cooler


[28-Jun-22 06:39 PM] BlitzIR#9944
It does


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] BlitzIR#9944
my only issue was say if the other dropper had nothing


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] BlitzIR#9944
would save me from having to give a diamond back to someone


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] BlitzIR#9944
and the buyer only getting 32


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] BlitzIR#9944
I will add glass tho


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] haha yes#0921
if you put in fireworks by the stack


[28-Jun-22 06:40 PM] haha yes#0921
you shouldnt have that problem


[28-Jun-22 06:41 PM] BlitzIR#9944
its by the stack


[28-Jun-22 06:41 PM] haha yes#0921
yeah exactly


[28-Jun-22 06:41 PM] haha yes#0921
if you put in a stack of fireworks in the one double chest


[28-Jun-22 06:41 PM] haha yes#0921
they would get split between the 2 droppers evenly

[28-Jun-22 06:44 PM] haha yes#0921
on the block the comparator is facing


[28-Jun-22 06:45 PM] BlitzIR#9944

[28-Jun-22 06:48 PM] Drewand#5174
are the droppers filled


[28-Jun-22 06:48 PM] BlitzIR#9944
yep


[28-Jun-22 06:49 PM] Drewand#5174
shouldnt there be a comparator turning off that torch to leave the light on


[28-Jun-22 06:49 PM] BlitzIR#9944
Idk


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] BlitzIR#9944
@haha yes u der?


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] haha yes#0921
nah


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] BlitzIR#9944
ok


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] haha yes#0921
wait


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] haha yes#0921
is there anything in there


[28-Jun-22 07:01 PM] haha yes#0921
in the dropper


[28-Jun-22 07:02 PM] BlitzIR#9944
lemme re-build the redstone


[28-Jun-22 07:02 PM] haha yes#0921
because if that torch down there is on


[28-Jun-22 07:03 PM] haha yes#0921
that means the comparator isnt powering it


[28-Jun-22 07:05 PM] BlitzIR#9944
i forgot to add the comparitor


[28-Jun-22 07:05 PM] BlitzIR#9944

[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] haha yes#0921

[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] BlitzIR#9944
i don't


[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] BlitzIR#9944
but i'll keep it


[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] BlitzIR#9944
now Imma add a noteblock


[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] BlitzIR#9944
just because


[28-Jun-22 07:08 PM] BlitzIR#9944
and because of the distribution I don't need a second lamp


[28-Jun-22 07:08 PM] BlitzIR#9944
thanks zol


[28-Jun-22 07:17 PM] BlitzIR#9944

[28-Jun-22 07:17 PM] BlitzIR#9944

[28-Jun-22 07:24 PM] BlitzIR#9944

Just a misunderstanding on my behalf


[28-Jun-22 07:26 PM] BlitzIR#9944
Now I gotta figure out how to add a noteblock confirmation sound


[28-Jun-22 07:35 PM] BlitzIR#9944
And I somehow fckin did it but it only does it while dispensing

BlitzIR making this machine only to realize he could have just used the Rex and T2 one that everyone‚Äôs been using since 1.16


[28-Jun-22 08:30 PM] BlitzIR#9944
I was about to resort to that because I used that design in 1.16 as well for my crappy sharpness v shop 

but this is cheaper in terms of resources
