Greetings, everyone! I'm Khaios! I guess I'm officially a fulltime YouTuber now, who makes gaming videos, almost exclusively on Terraria. I focus primarily on the building aspect, though I've been diving into let's plays lately, and mods in the future; and I created the TerraCorps Terraria SMP! I hope you all enjoy the content! ^.^

[23-Jun-22 10:33 AM] Skyla#1310
I wonder if anyone will make a mod that reverts some of the changes in 1.4 calamity


[23-Jun-22 10:33 AM] Dangerous8eans#0875
What are the changes


[23-Jun-22 10:36 AM] Skyla#1310
Ik alot of damage reduction stuff got nerfed, soaring insignia isn't unlimited flight, and there are other stuff that people don't like with how calamity nerfed vanilla stuff, like iirc zenith is post Yharon


[23-Jun-22 10:36 AM] Skyla#1310
If I'm reading something right, something got changed with the nurse


[23-Jun-22 10:48 AM] Skyla#1310

bout to take the SCal approach and just build a fuckin box


[24-Jun-22 02:39 AM] Tangmar#3209
definitely know what that means


[24-Jun-22 02:45 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
SCal is the (current) final boss of the calamity mod, and when you spawn them in they force you to fight them inside of a box


[24-Jun-22 02:46 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok

thats skeletron


[24-Jun-22 02:46 AM] Tangmar#3209
and i died


[24-Jun-22 02:47 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
because you asked for help i will copy and paste the wiki's "tips" section


[24-Jun-22 02:47 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
Defeating Skeletron is not necessary for game progression until Golem has been defeated. The Cultists, required for initiating the Lunar Events, will only spawn once both Golem and Skeletron have been defeated. However, skipping Skeletron in pre-Hardmode results in a lack of valuable Dungeon loot, in addition to access to the Mechanic as well as the Safe and Void Vault.
Do not jump onto Skeletron's head too many times with the Slime Mount, as going too high will cause it to despawn (also, in Space the low gravity will make it almost impossible to get back down past it).
Nonetheless, the Slime Mount can be a valuable tool inside of the Dungeon entrance, as well as a means to escape Skeletron's head spin attack, if one ever gets caught in it.
Any ricocheting weapon ( such as the Water Bolt found in the Dungeon) is very useful.
With multiple players, it is a good idea to set the spawn point near the Dungeon, so that players can simply rejoin the fight if they die.
While Skeletron is immune to many debuffs on the Old-gen console version Old-gen console version, Nintendo Nintendo 3DS version version, and tModLoader version tModLoader version, it is not immune to Frostburn on any version.
Attacking the hands first is advised as destroying them both will make it very easy to dodge Skeletron for the rest of the battle.
This is close to mandatory in Expert Mode, as Skeletron gains 25 defense for each hand it has alive.
Going fast enough on a Minecart can cause the hands to despawn.
In Expert Mode, if the player keeps moving in different directions, most homing skulls will miss; also note that they do not travel through tiles.
In Expert Mode, it is a good idea to use a yoyo or a flail and an overhead barrier.

calamity is out for 1.4 rn, but theres also fargo souls and vitality


[25-Jun-22 12:01 AM] Skyla#1310
What one out of those three would you suggest most?


[25-Jun-22 12:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543
that depends


[25-Jun-22 12:08 AM] Solar Awe#1543
if you want to go through calamity again -> calamity
if you want a good amount of difficulty-> fargo souls
if you want entirely new content built on 1.4 tmod -> vitality

from the vitality mod


[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Blaze#2568

[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
mmm


[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
try bullets?


[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Skyla#1310
I don't have any bullets, but it's firing rn


[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
then it probably doesnt take ammo


[25-Jun-22 01:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
not every ranged weapon uses ammo lol


[25-Jun-22 01:04 PM] Skyla#1310
It seems to have an unlimited source of ammo, but that still feels broken, even if it has an abysmally short range


[25-Jun-22 01:05 PM] Solar Awe#1543
it does 15 damage and appears to be from a dev set


[25-Jun-22 01:06 PM] Skyla#1310
Yea, it's still the best weapon I have rn


[25-Jun-22 01:07 PM] Solar Awe#1543
what stage are you in


[25-Jun-22 01:08 PM] Skyla#1310

if youre using fargo mutant use the instahouse


[25-Jun-22 01:14 PM] Skyla#1310
I didn't get Fargo's mutant, is that in 1.4 yet?


[25-Jun-22 01:15 PM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[25-Jun-22 01:16 PM] Solar Awe#1543
i have decided to kill prime because i kinda need to for a lot of things that need fright souls lol


[25-Jun-22 01:18 PM] Skyla#1310
If I already have a world going, is adding stuff like Fargo's mutant mod safe (like, it wouldn't do anything bad?)


[25-Jun-22 01:18 PM] Solar Awe#1543
yes its safe


[25-Jun-22 01:18 PM] Solar Awe#1543
mutant on its own only adds town npcs and additional qol items


[25-Jun-22 01:20 PM] Skyla#1310
Alright, I added Fargo's mutant mod and census


[25-Jun-22 01:21 PM] Solar Awe#1543
cool


[25-Jun-22 01:21 PM] Skyla#1310
Why did my brain put souls instead of mutant, probably because that was on the screen when I was typing


[25-Jun-22 01:21 PM] Solar Awe#1543
anyway alchnpc does not have support for calamity 1.4 yet so i will have to spawn in the combos


[25-Jun-22 01:21 PM] Solar Awe#1543
if you search just fargo youll get both mods


[25-Jun-22 01:22 PM] Solar Awe#1543
wait the calamity combo does nothing


[25-Jun-22 01:22 PM] Skyla#1310

[25-Jun-22 01:22 PM] Solar Awe#1543

[25-Jun-22 01:23 PM] Solar Awe#1543

[25-Jun-22 01:24 PM] Solar Awe#1543

It gets stuck at 1 second left on the timer and won't respawn me


[25-Jun-22 04:56 PM] Solar Awe#1543

Would buying the frying pan in vitality be worth it?


[25-Jun-22 05:44 PM] Solar Awe#1543
no clue


[25-Jun-22 07:08 PM] Solar Awe#1543

[25-Jun-22 07:09 PM] Solar Awe#1543
definitely didnt use cheatsheet paint tools


[25-Jun-22 07:09 PM] Solar Awe#1543
yep totally


[25-Jun-22 07:09 PM] Solar Awe#1543
*because who wants to mine all that brick anyway*


[25-Jun-22 07:15 PM] Solar Awe#1543
more cheatsheet is required, apparently.

if you want to try and get a decent bow and very good early summon yes

[26-Jun-22 12:03 AM] Skyla#1310
I need alot more game sense before I do expert/master


[26-Jun-22 12:03 AM] Solar Awe#1543
those increase fishing power for 10 catches


[26-Jun-22 12:03 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yea


[26-Jun-22 12:03 AM] Solar Awe#1543
but i think you can handle expert


[26-Jun-22 12:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
expert is mostly new ais + things have more health and damage


[26-Jun-22 12:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
i think i will work on my resource pack more tomorrow


[26-Jun-22 12:04 AM] Solar Awe#1543
i like how this turned out


[26-Jun-22 12:05 AM] Skyla#1310
I know enough about stuff like minecraft to do hardcore, but I still don't know too much about terraria to somewhat easily survive expert/master


[26-Jun-22 12:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yea


[26-Jun-22 12:05 AM] Skyla#1310
that looks nice


[26-Jun-22 12:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 12:06 AM] Solar Awe#1543
fairly easy


[26-Jun-22 12:06 AM] Tangmar#3209
if its easy for u im assuming its hard as fuck


[26-Jun-22 12:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543
you're probably playing on normal


[26-Jun-22 12:07 AM] Tangmar#3209
ye i am


[26-Jun-22 12:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 12:08 AM] Tangmar#3209
sounds easy enough


[26-Jun-22 12:08 AM] Skyla#1310
Solar, should I get better weapons/armor before EoC?


[26-Jun-22 12:08 AM] Skyla#1310
Or should I just build an arena and try


[26-Jun-22 12:08 AM] Skyla#1310
I do have enough lenses for a few attempts


[26-Jun-22 12:09 AM] Solar Awe#1543
just go for it rn imo

[26-Jun-22 12:18 AM] Solar Awe#1543
lmao


[26-Jun-22 12:18 AM] Skyla#1310
But it's named gets commonly shortened to EoC


[26-Jun-22 12:19 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[26-Jun-22 12:22 AM] Skyla#1310
Night is almost half over, I'll wait till tomorrow night


[26-Jun-22 12:24 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok any tips or stuff before i fight the eye or EoC as ppl say


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Solar Awe#1543
it has a phase 2


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Skyla#1310
Make a few platforms with some campfires


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Tangmar#3209
most bosses do


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Solar Awe#1543
look up the wiki page


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Tangmar#3209
smh solar expects me to look it up


[26-Jun-22 12:25 AM] Skyla#1310
I got ancient shadow greaves


[26-Jun-22 12:27 AM] Tangmar#3209
oh god the second phase is terrifying


[26-Jun-22 12:27 AM] Solar Awe#1543
nice


[26-Jun-22 12:27 AM] Skyla#1310
Iirc in pre-hm there aren't too many with a second phase


[26-Jun-22 12:28 AM] Solar Awe#1543
yep


[26-Jun-22 12:28 AM] Skyla#1310
Although I don't normally fight too many of the pre-hm bosses when I've played


[26-Jun-22 12:29 AM] Solar Awe#1543
skeletron technically has a phase 2 but not really


[26-Jun-22 12:29 AM] Solar Awe#1543
only in expert+


[26-Jun-22 12:32 AM] Solar Awe#1543
phase 2 in expert+ is mmm

you have too many campfires lmao


[26-Jun-22 12:44 AM] Solar Awe#1543
for an arena that size you only need 1 campfire


[26-Jun-22 12:44 AM] Skyla#1310
yea that should be good, yea you got too many campfires tho, keep the one in the middle


[26-Jun-22 12:44 AM] Tangmar#3209
at the start of my world i made like 20 accidentally so i kinda went overboard


[26-Jun-22 12:44 AM] Skyla#1310
I just realized I have a gravitation potion


[26-Jun-22 12:45 AM] Solar Awe#1543
use it


[26-Jun-22 12:45 AM] Solar Awe#1543
lmao nice


[26-Jun-22 12:46 AM] Tangmar#3209
i also found a cloud in a bottle


[26-Jun-22 12:46 AM] Skyla#1310
It's really useful to have rn


[26-Jun-22 12:46 AM] Skyla#1310
I will once I'm done trying EoC


[26-Jun-22 12:47 AM] Tangmar#3209
why isnt it letting me use the sus looking eye to summon EoC


[26-Jun-22 12:48 AM] Skyla#1310
A falling star just did half of EoC's damage


[26-Jun-22 12:48 AM] Skyla#1310
It has to be night


[26-Jun-22 12:51 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok that was insanely easy


[26-Jun-22 12:51 AM] Skyla#1310
Yea it is


[26-Jun-22 12:51 AM] Skyla#1310
I probably could use a better ranged weapon, but I always overestimate EoC when I play


[26-Jun-22 12:53 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok just defeated the second one hitless...


[26-Jun-22 12:53 AM] Skyla#1310
I forgot I had a mod that made boss summons unlimited


[26-Jun-22 12:54 AM] Skyla#1310
Yea, EoC is super weak

Solar, for magic storage, what's all needed to make it work?


[26-Jun-22 12:56 AM] Tangmar#3209
guys what should i do with my 32 demonite bars


[26-Jun-22 12:56 AM] Solar Awe#1543
gems, specifically diamond, emerald, and sapphire
tons of tungsten/silver (10 per storage unit)
some iron/lead for the components
some wood for the components 
other gems for upgrades


[26-Jun-22 12:57 AM] Solar Awe#1543
lights bane, demon bow, war axe of the night, fisher of souls


[26-Jun-22 12:57 AM] Skyla#1310
Alright, I'm meaning like the blocks, since I have a shadow diamond I can use but idk what to craft with it


[26-Jun-22 12:57 AM] Skyla#1310
With infinite EoC Summons, I can somewhat efficiently get money


[26-Jun-22 12:58 AM] Tangmar#3209
i made lights bane and its terrible :agony:


[26-Jun-22 12:58 AM] Tangmar#3209
and the axe is shameful literalyl 1984


[26-Jun-22 12:58 AM] Solar Awe#1543
take it to the guide


[26-Jun-22 12:58 AM] Solar Awe#1543
shadow diamond is a diamond substitute for magic storage recipes


[26-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok he said nothing about it


[26-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Skyla#1310
Is all these things when I search up shadow diamond needed?


[26-Jun-22 12:59 AM] Solar Awe#1543
check the Crafting option


[26-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Skyla#1310
I've never actually build stuff with magic storage


[26-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Tangmar#3209
ok?


[26-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Solar Awe#1543
only these:
- storage heart
- storage crafting interface
- storage unit


[26-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Solar Awe#1543
interact with the guide, click Crafting, and select lights bane


[26-Jun-22 01:01 AM] Tangmar#3209
ye i did its just telling my the stats


[26-Jun-22 01:01 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:01 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:04 AM] Skyla#1310
Wait, I'm confused with something, is there something else the blood's boundary makes?


[26-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Skyla#1310

[26-Jun-22 01:05 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:07 AM] Skyla#1310
I will, I've kept forgetting mods I should have


[26-Jun-22 01:07 AM] Tangmar#3209

[26-Jun-22 01:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:08 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:08 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:08 AM] Skyla#1310
Ok, now I see why the blood's boundary is there


[26-Jun-22 01:09 AM] Skyla#1310
It's better before the true varients, which just seems odd


[26-Jun-22 01:09 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[26-Jun-22 01:21 AM] Tangmar#3209

Idk where I can go to fight the Paladin spirit, I wish I could make an artificial dungeons


[27-Jun-22 11:50 PM] Skyla#1310
Can you make an artificial dungeon? The clothier sells these unsafe dungeon bricks and walls


[27-Jun-22 11:55 PM] Solar Awe#1543
use those


[27-Jun-22 11:55 PM] Solar Awe#1543
and make sure you also have dungeon bricks near them


[27-Jun-22 11:56 PM] Solar Awe#1543
criteria for dungeon biome:
- must be underground
- player must be behind a natural/unsafe dungeon wall
- must have ~250 dungeon bricks near the player


[27-Jun-22 11:57 PM] Skyla#1310
Alright, hopefully this will make fighting this boss easier


[28-Jun-22 12:39 AM] Skyla#1310
This is Taking a while


[28-Jun-22 12:41 AM] Solar Awe#1543
well


[28-Jun-22 12:41 AM] Solar Awe#1543
you're placing walls


[28-Jun-22 12:41 AM] Solar Awe#1543
a lot of them


[28-Jun-22 12:57 AM] Skyla#1310
I forgot I could get the cyborg, so now I'm gonna use rockets to blow what I was mining up


[28-Jun-22 12:58 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[28-Jun-22 01:00 AM] Skyla#1310
Rockets will make this faster

[28-Jun-22 01:19 AM] Skyla#1310
Accidentally blew up a few NPC's houses trying to get some Explorer combination potions


[28-Jun-22 01:19 AM] Solar Awe#1543
good one


[28-Jun-22 01:20 AM] Skyla#1310
Also I've accidentally hit myself with the splash damage like 6 times


[28-Jun-22 01:20 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[28-Jun-22 01:29 AM] Solar Awe#1543
and slower than normal flight


[28-Jun-22 01:29 AM] Tangmar#3209
i didnt even know there were mounts


[28-Jun-22 01:29 AM] Solar Awe#1543
you might get one by beating king slime


[28-Jun-22 01:31 AM] Skyla#1310
I'm very confused


[28-Jun-22 01:32 AM] Skyla#1310
I think terraria crashed or something


[28-Jun-22 01:32 AM] Solar Awe#1543
elaborate


[28-Jun-22 01:33 AM] Skyla#1310
It seemed to crash, but everything on screen looked normal, just I was invincible and my inputs didn't go through


[28-Jun-22 01:33 AM] Solar Awe#1543
what


[28-Jun-22 01:33 AM] Solar Awe#1543
have you tried disabling boss checklist


[28-Jun-22 01:33 AM] Skyla#1310
I don't see how boss checklist could've caused this


[28-Jun-22 01:34 AM] Tangmar#3209
solar just hates boss checklist


[28-Jun-22 01:34 AM] Skyla#1310
It does have a few things it's caused


[28-Jun-22 01:34 AM] Skyla#1310
But those had another factor, like dying, but I just seemed to crash mid way through the event


[28-Jun-22 01:35 AM] Solar Awe#1543
it's had 4+ updates in the past 2 days lmao


[28-Jun-22 01:35 AM] Solar Awe#1543
try disabling it


[28-Jun-22 01:36 AM] Tangmar#3209
it just keeps dropping ninja pants :agony:i killed it like 5 times


[28-Jun-22 01:37 AM] Solar Awe#1543
keep killing it


[28-Jun-22 01:37 AM] Solar Awe#1543
search for a slimy saddle


[28-Jun-22 01:37 AM] Tangmar#3209
i ran out of rubys


[28-Jun-22 01:39 AM] Skyla#1310
I found the factor for these crashes


[28-Jun-22 01:40 AM] Solar Awe#1543
which is


[28-Jun-22 01:40 AM] Skyla#1310

Why is it so buggy


[28-Jun-22 01:41 AM] Solar Awe#1543
remember that tmodloader 1.4 is essentially a beta


[28-Jun-22 01:41 AM] Skyla#1310
I thought this was a stable version at this point, not a beta


[28-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Solar Awe#1543
it's technically stable


[28-Jun-22 01:42 AM] Solar Awe#1543
but also mods are updating to the preview version to prepare for the next stable update


[28-Jun-22 01:43 AM] Skyla#1310
I feel so weak in this event


[28-Jun-22 01:43 AM] Solar Awe#1543
martians do that


[28-Jun-22 01:44 AM] Skyla#1310
My best weapon is a shroomite dart blaster, and the next best weapon I can think of, it's one that seems to be intented to be got after paladin spirt, but can be gotten beforehand


[28-Jun-22 01:44 AM] Solar Awe#1543
mmm i forgot i haven't played vanilla ranger in literally years


[28-Jun-22 01:44 AM] Solar Awe#1543
i got nothing

It is alot better


[28-Jun-22 02:03 AM] Skyla#1310

xenopopper


[28-Jun-22 02:56 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
or snowman cannon


[28-Jun-22 02:57 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
xeno + chloro bullets is pretty good


[28-Jun-22 02:57 AM] λcertified narcissist#4096
i usually just go megashark -> xenopopper -> chaingun -> snowman cannon


[28-Jun-22 05:29 PM] Skyla#1310
I wonder if any of the big mods would and anything for the special seeds


[28-Jun-22 05:30 PM] Skyla#1310
I have no clue why I can do easily craft souls of Vitality, if they're dropped by the Paladin spirit, I mean, iirc there is a drop or two that would be good for me, but the main thing was the souls I wanted


[28-Jun-22 05:38 PM] Solar Awe#1543
i don't know either

that is the only advice i can tell you

practice makes perfect


[28-Jun-22 09:07 PM] Solar Awe#1543
i will say: melee does have the best weapons in the mod


[28-Jun-22 09:07 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
google has told me that and im following its advice


[28-Jun-22 09:07 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
this does feel like a boss where you really just have to learn the moveset and utilize EVERYTHING in your toolkit


[28-Jun-22 09:07 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
time stop, invincible dash, everything


[28-Jun-22 09:08 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
its convenient i guess

[29-Jun-22 01:58 PM] Solar Awe#1543
SEE
i still stand by the fact that aureus is the most bs boss in the mod


[29-Jun-22 01:59 PM] Blaze#2568
He has too much health


[29-Jun-22 01:59 PM] Blaze#2568
and maybe too much damage


[29-Jun-22 01:59 PM] Blaze#2568
because the astral infection damage is there, his attacks should do less


[29-Jun-22 02:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543

my first terraria run i did a while ago was ranger


[29-Jun-22 08:40 PM] Jacki#4312
chlorophyte bullets are a life saver if you’re bad (me)


[29-Jun-22 09:27 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
you're looking at this the wrong way


[29-Jun-22 09:28 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
chlorophyte bullets arent good for bad players, chlorophyte bullets are good for players that focus on dodging


[29-Jun-22 09:29 PM] Solar Awe#1543
:true:


[29-Jun-22 09:29 PM] Solar Awe#1543
but also chloro bullets are shit at multi-target

:copium:


[29-Jun-22 09:40 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
i got mutant to 2%


[29-Jun-22 09:40 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
im so upset


[29-Jun-22 09:40 PM] Solar Awe#1543
F


[29-Jun-22 09:45 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
what attacks does the time stop even work on


[29-Jun-22 09:45 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
it seems like it freezes the things the mutant spawns but not the mutant itself


[29-Jun-22 09:45 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
maybe it works on the destroyer attack


[29-Jun-22 09:53 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
i freezed time at the wrong time and my game nearly crashed


[29-Jun-22 09:53 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
wow


[29-Jun-22 10:13 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096

I was told 250x250, that was 250x250


[29-Jun-22 10:20 PM] Solar Awe#1543

[29-Jun-22 10:27 PM] Blaze#2568
Is there something better then zerg potions for farming because I need to be able to destroy hundreds of enemys in the span of 5 seconds or I am not happy


[29-Jun-22 10:27 PM] Solar Awe#1543
fargo mutant -> battle cry


[29-Jun-22 10:28 PM] Blaze#2568
Time to kill


[29-Jun-22 10:31 PM] Blaze#2568
I am now wanted on many watch lists


[29-Jun-22 10:37 PM] Blaze#2568
Why are the potions so expensive to make with blood orbs, you can not make me fish, game.


[29-Jun-22 10:43 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
oh you're serious that had to be the last attack

i did it


[29-Jun-22 10:57 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
i dont even want to guess how many tries that was


[29-Jun-22 10:58 PM] Solar Awe#1543
gg


[29-Jun-22 10:58 PM] Solar Awe#1543
now open the bag


[29-Jun-22 10:58 PM] Skyla#1310
Yea, this area is around 250x250


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] Solar Awe#1543
i think that initial square area you filled with walls is more rhan enough to fight the spirit


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
i gotta kill it one more time to get enough energy to dupe


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
mutant eye makes it easier


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
:catge:


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] Solar Awe#1543
after all you're not making a polter arena


[29-Jun-22 10:59 PM] Solar Awe#1543
Yes


[29-Jun-22 11:00 PM] Skyla#1310
I could just do this then probably moon lord


[29-Jun-22 11:00 PM] Solar Awe#1543
yes


[29-Jun-22 11:01 PM] Solar Awe#1543
but yea the area you have already is probably way more than enough


[29-Jun-22 11:01 PM] Solar Awe#1543
when i fought paladin spirit i didn't even bother making an arena and it was still easy on master lmao


[29-Jun-22 11:02 PM] Skyla#1310
Spirit box isn't working here


[29-Jun-22 11:02 PM] Skyla#1310
I have like the smallest dungeon


[29-Jun-22 11:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
place dungeon bricks around to make walls


[29-Jun-22 11:03 PM] Solar Awe#1543
dungeon biome still requires bricks to be around


[29-Jun-22 11:07 PM] λcertified narcissist#4096
and just like that

fargos souls done


[29-Jun-22 11:15 PM] Skyla#1310
I carved a bit of this dungeon out, and used crystal darts, this was very strong


[29-Jun-22 11:20 PM] Solar Awe#1543
well yeah, crystal darts have smart bounce


[29-Jun-22 11:20 PM] Solar Awe#1543
welcome to the club


[29-Jun-22 11:20 PM] Jacki#4312
i would go play terraria because all i need for skele prime summon are souls of night but i’m at my aunts


[29-Jun-22 11:20 PM] Solar Awe#1543
terraria is on mobile


[29-Jun-22 11:20 PM] Solar Awe#1543
play the entire game again, on the go


[29-Jun-22 11:21 PM] Jacki#4312
yeah but 1. don’t have the same world and 2. i would be 10x than i already am


[29-Jun-22 11:21 PM] Jacki#4312
also playing mage because last prism looks hot


[29-Jun-22 11:24 PM] Skyla#1310
What should I prep when going to fight moon lord?


[29-Jun-22 11:25 PM] Solar Awe#1543
what you would expect


[29-Jun-22 11:25 PM] Solar Awe#1543
see if any of your accessories need upgrades


[29-Jun-22 11:45 PM] Skyla#1310
Maybe I should do EoL


[29-Jun-22 11:59 PM] Skyla#1310
I'm trying to do lunitic, I don't think my normal statagy of making a box and spamming crystal darts with a shroomite dart blaster will work for lunitic


[30-Jun-22 12:07 AM] Solar Awe#1543
well yea


[30-Jun-22 12:15 AM] Skyla#1310
Xenopopper made it very easy


[30-Jun-22 12:17 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[30-Jun-22 12:33 AM] Skyla#1310
Should I start a different mod?


[30-Jun-22 12:34 AM] Solar Awe#1543

[30-Jun-22 12:48 AM] Skyla#1310
