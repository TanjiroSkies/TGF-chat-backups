TGForever Rules
Below are rules that the Mod Team enforces. We have four overarching sections that all members must abide by. Please also read the thread  below to fully understand what is enforced, and the code used when a moderator points a violator.
**1. Personal Attacks, Hate Speech, and Harassment**
Do not personally attack (PA) other users, whether it be violence, prejudice, harassment, or leaking private information
**2. Inappropriate Discussion**
The following discussions are not allowed: spamming (including mass pings), channel misuse, foriegn language, sensitive topics in a joking matter, advertising, and dangerous submissions.
This server has a blacklist. The following words are not allowed to be used and will result in automatic deletion of messages: ||fag/faggot, kys/kill yourself, nigger/nigga, retard, tranny||. A soft blacklist consists of the words: ||cum, fetish, horny, kink||. Read rule 2f in the thread for details about the soft blacklist.
**3. Inappropriate Media**
No NSFW, both borderline and explicit, content is allowed. This includes shock media and gore.

We use a point-based moderation system for punishments via @Unknown. Read the thread for points given by rule code and the punishment given at each point.
