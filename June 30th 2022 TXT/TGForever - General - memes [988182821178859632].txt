It's no secret that Uku is an asshole. She's rude, she's unprofessional, and she has a history of being abusive to her staff. But despite all of this, I believe she should be reinstated as an administrator. Here's why:  


1) She has admitted to her mistakes and promised to change. While it's true that Uku has been abusive in the past, she has acknowledged her errors and vowed to change her behavior. I believe people can change, and I think Uku should be given another chance. 

2) Pedophilia is not a crime. While it is undoubtedly icky, pedophilia is not actually a crime in most countries (including the United States). Therefore, even though Uku may be attracted to children, she hasn't actually done anything wrong. 

3) She's good at her job. Let's face it: Uku is a smart woman, and she knows how to get things done. She's an effective administrator, and I believe she would do a great job if given another chance. 

4) The staff needs her. While Uku may be challenging to work with, the staff at the organization she administered truly need her expertise. Without her, the organization would likely fall apart. 

5) Forgiveness is important. It's important to forgive people for their mistakes, even if they haven't changed yet. Holding a grudge only hurts yourself in the end; it doesn't do any good for anyone else. Therefore, let's forgive Uku and give her another chance as an administrator.

@ovalgoatkid 
I was an icewayman
Along the ice roads I did fly
With sword and radar by my side
Many a rando lost their diamonds to my raids
Many a dono lost their XP to my blade
The bastards banned me on December '29th
But I am still alive

I was a dono
With diamond armor I did ride
With Foli client I did abide
I raided randos in the streets of The Meadow
I went around to slaughter players in one blow
And when the bombs went off they said that I got killed
But I am hacking still

I was a bedrocker
I cross'd the highways far and wide
Where ice and lava did collide 
A place called hooters on the east nether highway
I griefed, then fell into the lavafields below 
They banned me quicker than my boots could hit the ground 
But my alt is still around 
It'll always be around, and around 
and around And around 
and around and around 

I'll fly an Elytra
Across the server shut' divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to store my diamonds if I can
Perhaps I may become an icewayman again
Or I'll simply try to drive the mods insane
But I will remain

And I'll come back again, and again
And again and again and again and again
And again

Best faith interpretation: brown v board overturned ~60 years of precedent starting with Plessy v Ferguson, so ‚ÄúRoe was precedent‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid argument to made

What was most likely meant: I honestly have no clue


[26-Jun-22 12:17 AM] 5space#8508
he is using this to "prove" that precedent doesnt matter because bad thing get overturned good


[26-Jun-22 12:18 AM] 5space#8508
worst phrasing of the century right there and  also this draws pro segregation conservatives out of the woodwork

I am not crazy! I know he swapped those numbers. I knew it was 1216. One after Magna Carta. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. That billboard! Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? No! *He* orchestrated it! Jimmy! He *defecated* through a *sunroof*! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own firm! What was I *thinking*? He'll never change. He'll *never* change! Ever since he was 9, *always* the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious *Jimmy*! Stealing them blind! And *HE* gets to be a lawyer? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance!
