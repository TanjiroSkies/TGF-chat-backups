[19-Jun-22 06:08 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Combination of nonattentive mods in the channel and most user posts being tons of images hides things quickly


[19-Jun-22 06:08 PM] Zap#8938
but me and chep have no memory of it being deleted

[19-Jun-22 06:11 PM] Humanpest#3129
Not being a core state


[19-Jun-22 06:11 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
You could have resolved that peacefully.

[19-Jun-22 06:14 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
At least let them do what they should do.


[19-Jun-22 06:14 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226

The Irish are not worthy of aiming a rifle at good Ulstermen.

No


[19-Jun-22 06:22 PM] Humanpest#3129

we see Avdol already has Magician's Red when he confronts Dio for the first time


[19-Jun-22 06:49 PM] Chephadrom#0562
They were originally antagonists, so assume dio/enya stabbed them

Araki pretty clearly wasn't expecting to continue the series from Part 3 onwards lmao


[19-Jun-22 06:51 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Yeah the same plot hole exists around when araki said that if people could see stands in pt2 they‚Äôd see Joseph with hermit purple

Actually not entirely


[19-Jun-22 06:52 PM] Zap#8938
That was explained by how Hamon is itself a manner of stand in a way


[19-Jun-22 06:52 PM] Zap#8938
See, if your Hamon is strong enough, you'll develop Hermit Purple regardless of whether you get stabbed with the arrow


[19-Jun-22 06:52 PM] Zap#8938
That's why Jonathan also has Hermit Purple


[19-Jun-22 06:53 PM] Zap#8938
him using Hamon granted him such


[19-Jun-22 06:53 PM] Zap#8938
and Hermit Purple's ability depends on the strength of your hamon


[19-Jun-22 06:53 PM] Zap#8938
for example Joseph's hamon was strong enough to read minds (hence his "your next line is" moments)


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
so Hermit Purple got spirit photography


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
And next your gonna say "Young Joseph did not have Hermit Purple"


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
he did tho


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
in a way


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
Nope


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
araki said so


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
Only had it when dio stabbed


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
he couldn't use it


[19-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Zap#8938
but he had it


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Humanpest#3129
Because thats his soul


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Humanpest#3129
It was with him but also not there


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
but hermit purple is the stand for every hamon user though


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
it's like


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Humanpest#3129
As if it was he would have seen it


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
hamon makes your stand hermit purple


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
you can't use it yet


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
you need the arrow or a strong enough hamon for that


[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
but it sort of overrides your stand

[19-Jun-22 06:55 PM] Zap#8938
and we can guess that from Jonathan also having hermit purple


[19-Jun-22 06:56 PM] Zap#8938
there's actually this cool theory on how Ultimate Kars would have one of the strongest stands of all time


[19-Jun-22 06:56 PM] Zap#8938
since his Hamon is hundreds of times stronger than Joseph's


[19-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Zap#8938
so his hermit purple would have telepathic abilities that exceed most other stands

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Just got called to war by Castile in their conquest of Siena


[21-Jun-22 10:16 AM] Chephadrom#0562
They didn‚Äôt send a single troop over, and my territories in Europe got harassed constantly by savoy and Siena who had gotten condottieri from France


[21-Jun-22 10:16 AM] Chephadrom#0562
And then they fucking peaced out without even taking the province


[21-Jun-22 10:17 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I am rather impressed that the French ai saw a chance to essentially wage a proxy war against me and successfully did so


[21-Jun-22 04:00 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Just found out there is a way to turn off the goddamn guns drums and steel and sabaton music


[21-Jun-22 04:00 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Thank god

Now I‚Äôm not *saying* I think this is undeserved. But I think think this is undeserved


[21-Jun-22 11:36 PM] Chephadrom#0562
I am kept afloat solely by the fact that the ai are only able to siege down my continental European holdings, and can‚Äôt get to Britain itself.


[21-Jun-22 11:39 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Since it‚Äôs a punitive war it says that if I get 10% positive warscore from battles, and stay like that I‚Äôll get ticking warscore


[21-Jun-22 11:39 PM] Chephadrom#0562
So I think the play might be to wait this out in England where the enemy armies can‚Äôt get me


[21-Jun-22 11:43 PM] Chephadrom#0562
I‚Äôve taken out multiple loans and debased my currency a couple times


[21-Jun-22 11:43 PM] Chephadrom#0562

Me after waking up remembering I have to continue this stupid ass war


[22-Jun-22 11:26 AM] Chephadrom#0562
When I left the game all the coalition forces were in Portugal carpet sieging them down, so I might have a chance to make a run to siege the papacy


[22-Jun-22 11:33 AM] Chephadrom#0562
If the worst happens, I‚Äôm fine really with them partitioning my land and forcing me to give up the French land I recently conquered


[22-Jun-22 11:34 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I can focus on colonizing the americas and come back later


[22-Jun-22 11:37 AM] Chephadrom#0562
Castille also broke their alliance with me and declared me as a rival, so that means I‚Äôm eventually free to attack Aragon for control of Mallorca and Sardinia


[22-Jun-22 03:39 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Okay I‚Äôm being forced to abandon this game

My ramblings about my England game


[23-Jun-22 12:23 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I definitely did go to far after annexing northern France, which is what caused the coalition to form


[23-Jun-22 12:24 AM] Tangmar#3209
holy hell swiss


[23-Jun-22 12:24 AM] Chephadrom#0562
And in hindsight it might have been a bad idea to convert to Protestantism right afterwards, thus pissing off everyone in Europe(especially the pope, who led the first coalition)


[23-Jun-22 12:26 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I think after I fully consolidate the British isles it might be a better plan to just focus on colonization and let my AE fall down, as well as spent time developing my country


[23-Jun-22 12:26 AM] Chephadrom#0562
And maybe do the Mediterranean missions in the meantime


[23-Jun-22 12:27 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I am really proud about how well I was doing initially though, before I got fucked by multiple huge wars

Everyone in Europe hated my so much that it was actually easier for me to try and befriend the Muslim kingdoms instead

[23-Jun-22 12:45 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875
Idk, I don't know any strategy games I just someone talking about Europe hating them


[23-Jun-22 12:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
They expected the average hoi4 german player


[23-Jun-22 12:54 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
I am a European. I don't hate them. I play them.


[23-Jun-22 12:54 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Me?


[23-Jun-22 12:54 PM] Humanpest#3129

[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] Humanpest#3129
Neither do i


[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875
Was that a death threat or a conversion threat


[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] Humanpest#3129
The first one


[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] Humanpest#3129
But in a joking manner


[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875

[23-Jun-22 12:56 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226

Oh


[23-Jun-22 12:59 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
I fully agree with this being blacklisted, but why?


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875
Glad we blacklisted fmboys, cringe people don't stfu about them


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] Cooopl#5402
Becuase it was bringing out uncomfortable and inappropriate discussion


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] Humanpest#3129
So f e m boy is blacklisted


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
That they shouldn't exist?


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] Humanpest#3129
But Nazi's are not


[23-Jun-22 01:00 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875

But people don't like ze fascisti.


[23-Jun-22 01:01 PM] Humanpest#3129
Thats good


[23-Jun-22 01:01 PM] Humanpest#3129
And it should stay that way


[23-Jun-22 01:01 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
But Emma tries to turn me, Herald and Lucas into the blacklisted people.


[23-Jun-22 01:01 PM] Humanpest#3129
My god...


[23-Jun-22 01:02 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226

[23-Jun-22 01:06 PM] Dangerous8eans#0875

[23-Jun-22 02:02 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Possible question


[23-Jun-22 02:02 PM] Chephadrom#0562
Could any earlier work


[23-Jun-22 02:02 PM] Chephadrom#0562

[23-Jun-22 06:19 PM] LysFisk#6975
I just formed portugal as soon as I could and quit the game :trollsmirk:


[23-Jun-22 06:36 PM] Humanpest#3129
Should have converted to eu4


[23-Jun-22 06:36 PM] Humanpest#3129
Smh


[23-Jun-22 06:38 PM] LysFisk#6975
If you dont convert every game from IR>CK3>EU4>Fallen Eagle II>VIC2>HOI4>Stellaris


[23-Jun-22 06:38 PM] LysFisk#6975
what the FUCK are you doing?!??!


[23-Jun-22 06:44 PM] LucasRivi#0472
what's fallen eagle 2


[23-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Humanpest#3129
Ikr


[23-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Humanpest#3129
Only a true paradox player will do that


[23-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Humanpest#3129
Or you can do what i do


[23-Jun-22 06:47 PM] Humanpest#3129

20 year long hoi4 campaign


[23-Jun-22 06:48 PM] LysFisk#6975
Why would you ever subject yourself to that :civ:


[23-Jun-22 06:49 PM] LysFisk#6975
Worst game paradox ever made, set in napoleonic times


[23-Jun-22 06:49 PM] Humanpest#3129
Because i was bored


[23-Jun-22 06:49 PM] Humanpest#3129
Better than the 30 year long game though


[23-Jun-22 06:50 PM] Humanpest#3129
Hey @LysFisk  what was your longest paradox campaifn


[23-Jun-22 06:51 PM] LysFisk#6975
I think I did a CK3>Eu4>Vic2 game as the Western roman empire


[23-Jun-22 06:52 PM] LysFisk#6975
But like the vic 2 conversion fucked development so hard from Eu4


[23-Jun-22 06:53 PM] LysFisk#6975
Super high dev in EU4, go to VIC2 and have like 10m population (owning the majority of the Roman empire)


[23-Jun-22 06:53 PM] LysFisk#6975
Conversions just get to wonky past Eu4


[23-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
Woah thats long


[23-Jun-22 06:54 PM] Humanpest#3129
Did you ever have hoi4?


[23-Jun-22 06:55 PM] LysFisk#6975
I tried to convert my game into hoi4 but I was literally not even a major power despite owning half of Europe üò≠


[23-Jun-22 06:55 PM] LysFisk#6975
I have spent an ungodly ammount of time on that game tho


[23-Jun-22 06:56 PM] Humanpest#3129
Oh wow


[23-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
I guess major depends on factories too


[23-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
Because


[23-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
I was Ireland i became a major power until ww2 ended


[23-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
Because when i invaded britain i got their factories


[23-Jun-22 06:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
And after war i gave some to canada


[23-Jun-22 06:58 PM] Humanpest#3129
Reducing mg factory count


[23-Jun-22 06:58 PM] Humanpest#3129
And then becoming a minor


[23-Jun-22 06:58 PM] LysFisk#6975
Yeah factories have gotta affect it


[23-Jun-22 06:59 PM] Humanpest#3129
They do


[23-Jun-22 06:59 PM] Humanpest#3129
And its annoying


[23-Jun-22 07:00 PM] Humanpest#3129
Like someone might become a major due to off map factories


[23-Jun-22 07:00 PM] Humanpest#3129
But for the conversation i suggest making a faction


[23-Jun-22 07:01 PM] LysFisk#6975
Whar


[23-Jun-22 07:08 PM] Humanpest#3129
A faction


[23-Jun-22 07:08 PM] Humanpest#3129
Instantly turns you into a major


[23-Jun-22 07:09 PM] LysFisk#6975
True ig, but you need the spirit that allows it


[23-Jun-22 07:09 PM] LysFisk#6975
and that game was like one and a half year ago

Or i tried


[25-Jun-22 05:57 PM] Humanpest#3129
until i was murdered by an Unknown assassin


[25-Jun-22 05:58 PM] LysFisk#6975
alls well that ends well :swaguwu:


[25-Jun-22 06:12 PM] Humanpest#3129
I sure wonder who that Murderer was


[25-Jun-22 06:12 PM] Humanpest#3129
But seriously we have some Games Of thrones level of backstabbing ang Murderering


[26-Jun-22 04:55 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Well, it mostly is the two of us.


[26-Jun-22 04:55 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
This all started when you tried to murder me.


[26-Jun-22 05:50 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Between me and pest? Well, Pest tried to murder me, so I seduced his wife. One of his 'children' was mine. My bastard, which I of course revealed. But we married that bastard off to my half-sister by accident. Pest also murdered my mother, his grandmother,  by accident. But Pest wasn't playing Pest yet, so I first murdered off 90% of his family, 3 in duels the others by other means. Then Pest played Pest, but there was a scheme to murder me, I immediately thought it was Pest, and I murdered him just before evidence came he didn't do it. After that Pest tried to murder me, but I got killed in a duel with the king of Sweden. (I murdered 5 kings of Sweden, they all appointed me as their spymaster.) And now there is chaos in the isles, and chaos in Norway, where I am situated.


[26-Jun-22 05:51 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
It is funny, since Pest's entire dynasty is my descendants at this moment.


[26-Jun-22 05:51 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
At least his branch. The non-related members of his branch had a minor case of death.


[26-Jun-22 05:53 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
So basically pure chaos and incest.


[26-Jun-22 06:48 AM] LucasRivi#0472
like medieval Europe irl


[26-Jun-22 06:49 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Well, in medieval Europe people did not exterminate an entire family of nobles because someone tried to murder them.


[26-Jun-22 06:50 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Pest didn't even try to murder me the second incident. I just took my revenge on him.


[26-Jun-22 06:56 AM] Humanpest#3129
Its even funnier the second time


[26-Jun-22 06:57 AM] Humanpest#3129
Also keep in my mind Pest married his aunt which was your sister


[26-Jun-22 06:57 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Yeah.


[26-Jun-22 06:57 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
We seriously need to continue this game.


[26-Jun-22 06:57 AM] Humanpest#3129
Y e s


[26-Jun-22 06:57 AM] Humanpest#3129
And it seems Pest has gotten alot of the murder from your side of the family


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] Humanpest#3129
Killed 8 Rulers


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
He inherited.


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Pathetic.


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] Humanpest#3129
And then got murdered by an unknown person


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
I killed 5 Swedish kings in one lifetime.


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
By duel and by snake.


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
And also some others.


[26-Jun-22 06:58 AM] Humanpest#3129
Well rn he is plotting to kill Normandy


[26-Jun-22 06:59 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Good man.


[26-Jun-22 06:59 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
I am just murdering everyone in Norway.


[26-Jun-22 07:00 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
What happened Pest, we are relatives, at the start of the game you were my stepfather, and now we have been plotting against each other like this.


[26-Jun-22 07:00 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
We should rekindle our alliance and emigrate to north Africa.


[26-Jun-22 07:02 AM] Humanpest#3129
Yeah sure


[26-Jun-22 07:02 AM] Humanpest#3129
But first i must murder the Kings of the Isles


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] Humanpest#3129
And reclaim my great grandfathers land


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] Humanpest#3129
My other great grandfather


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
No, my islands are mine.


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Those stupid little islands there are mine for a reason.


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
But you can get the entirety of Ireland and Great Britain.


[26-Jun-22 07:03 AM] Humanpest#3129
Oh i mean like that place near scotlabd


[26-Jun-22 07:04 AM] Humanpest#3129

[26-Jun-22 07:04 AM] Humanpest#3129
Great Grandfather owned that


[26-Jun-22 07:04 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Those little islands right off Scotland that I control now?


[26-Jun-22 07:04 AM] Humanpest#3129

@LysFisk, @Humanpest, when do we continue?

How late?


[26-Jun-22 02:20 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
Anything after 14:00 is good for me.


[26-Jun-22 02:24 PM] LysFisk#6975

Dont have one but Andalus has conquered basically everything outside of a thin strip in the north of spain + Catalonia


[26-Jun-22 06:49 PM] LysFisk#6975
Also there are 3 different christian herecies alive and well in the christian kingdoms of Iberia :poggers:


[26-Jun-22 06:50 PM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226

I mean, Castille was a pretty strong kingdom, until I ruined it.


[27-Jun-22 03:59 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
So probably no.


[27-Jun-22 04:12 AM] Zap#8938
Andalus conquering all of Iberia except the Asturias is something that happened historically tho


[27-Jun-22 04:13 AM] Zap#8938
and the Asturias are a thin strip of northeren land


[27-Jun-22 04:22 AM] JuistNietOpVallend#5226
I mean, it is entirely weakened now. I think that Al Andalus will conquer it.

@LysFisk, is it an idea that we just start around 3 then? Pest does that suit you too?


[27-Jun-22 04:40 PM] Humanpest#3129
Idk


[27-Jun-22 04:45 PM] LysFisk#6975
I have to do a thing at 17:30, so Id have to stop playing at like 16:30
