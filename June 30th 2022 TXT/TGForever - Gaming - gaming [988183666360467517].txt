[20-Jun-22 04:40 PM] Chephadrom#0562
I once took a break from xenoblade 2 and when I came back I legit couldn’t play it because the mechanics were so stupidly complicated


[20-Jun-22 04:41 PM] haha yes#0921
is this why they need a whole 20 minute presentation about the game 5 seconds before it releases


[20-Jun-22 04:42 PM] haha yes#0921
not buying the game anyway it looks like genshin impact


[20-Jun-22 04:42 PM] haha yes#0921

[20-Jun-22 11:05 PM] Wtnautical#8826
Here’s hoping for the 29th


[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] Tangmar#3209

[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] Wtnautical#8826
It would be better without xenoblade 20 minute insert anyways


[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] haha yes#0921
True


[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] haha yes#0921
That direct would have been the worst one ever


[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] haha yes#0921
But it announced the miitopia remaster /port


[20-Jun-22 11:06 PM] Wtnautical#8826
Where is the direct ranking board


[20-Jun-22 11:07 PM] haha yes#0921
So its the most average direct ever


[20-Jun-22 11:08 PM] Tangmar#3209

[20-Jun-22 11:12 PM] haha yes#0921
I did


[20-Jun-22 11:12 PM] haha yes#0921
So I bought it instantly on switch


[20-Jun-22 11:12 PM] haha yes#0921

[20-Jun-22 11:19 PM] Chephadrom#0562

[20-Jun-22 11:37 PM] Chephadrom#0562
I’m interested to see where they take the connection between the first and second games


[20-Jun-22 11:38 PM] Chephadrom#0562
I just hope it’s closer to to xenoblade 1 than 2


[20-Jun-22 11:41 PM] Tangmar#3209

||true||


[21-Jun-22 12:00 AM] Chephadrom#0562
I joke, but in regards to how the series treats ||dunsparce|| it would be hilarious to see in the anime/games as a gag


[21-Jun-22 12:01 AM] Tangmar#3209
||it would be funny casue ppl have been begging for a dunsparce evo for years and its just slightly bigger||

Dial L For Luigi
Luigi is a private investigator that’s down on his luck. The cases have dried up and he’s struggling to pay rent… until Princess Peach walks through his door. He hadn’t seen her since THAT incident during a Mario Kart Star Cup tournament, but she’s promising him a handsome sum of money if he can become a sort of Super Luigi detective and look in...
