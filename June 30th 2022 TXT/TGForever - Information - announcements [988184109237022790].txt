@Terraria 

Sorry for the short notice, but because we don't have the TGF bot up and running, the Terraria server will have to be delayed until **next week**.

Hey @everyone! This announcement will be straight to the point.

**TGForever is getting a new name.** A form has been linked in this announcement to suggest new community names. This form can be filled out as many times as desired.

However, to maintain consistency, **The community will retain the current "TGF" acronym.** All submitted name suggestions must follow this rule.

The best suggestions will be collected in a survey to decide the official name of the TGF community going forward.

Form link: https://forms.gle/mYHoc3CbZ4hAK4cF8

As a general reminder, make sure to keep your passwords secure, only post your account information on the official Discord website, and enable 2 factor authentication for an extra layer of security

Another reminder: If you did join the server in any case, **if you are on mobile, report the server under Something else -> Malicious Links**.
