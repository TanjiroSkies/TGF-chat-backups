when will we change our name to something other than TG "forever" considering how easy it is to not make it forever
Reason from Salt#5507
we were in the process of discussing community rebranding before today‚Äôs incident occurred. Once we settle the server‚Äôs situation following this, expect something regarding a server name change / rebrand.

possible TikTok idea: maybe just have the content team fuck around on the server and post funny moments in 15 second clips then throw the logo and ip at the end. Could be a pretty easy way to get some people in here as long as we're consistent, and it doesn't have to have too much quality since it's just tiktok clips.
Reason from Hapho#3077
Has been considered. If there are no tgf clips on tiktok in the near future you can yell at content team and mods

ok i made the above one as a slight joke/jib at teenserv debates and the shithole it was, but ppl seem to like it unironically so some ideas if we want to make an actual politics thing.

- pin political compass test and perhaps have some kind of command with bot to do !compass <user>, again idk if anyone is willing to do bot stuff for this but would be useful i think. 
- encourage any kind of debates in general political wise to be had in that channel. 
- (this is obv) moderate to ensure civil discussion and debating, if you want to go UK parliment style get a speaker role and let them scream at ppl to shut the fuck up (I ‚ù§Ô∏è john bercow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn5THTi6Zbg). 
- if you want to make it a full on organised debates channel, perhaps allow voting on weekly topics to talk about (or just encourage posting of news articles and discussion of them) would be a nice idea. And again, a bit like movie night, a debates night is a quick and easy event which increases server activity. 
- i could go on for ages about ideas but threads exist so feel free to talk about shit there. and pls can a mod or ct actually read this ty :)
